Figure 9.1 Political Power from a Cotton Monopoly In the mid-nineteenth
century, the United States, specifically the Southern states, had a near
monopoly in the cotton that they supplied to Great Britain. These states
attempted to leverage this economic power into political power---trying
to sway Great Britain to formally recognize the Confederate States of
America. (Credit: modification of \"cotton!\" by ashley/Flickr, CC BY

## Introduction to a Monopoly

### Bring It Home {#bring-it-home .Heading3Grey}

#### The Rest is History {#the-rest-is-history .Heading4Grey}

Many of the opening case studies have focused on current events. This
one steps into the past to observe how monopoly, or near monopolies,
have helped shape history. In spring 1773, the East India Company, a
firm that, in its time, was designated "too big to fail," was
experiencing financial difficulties. To help shore up the failing firm,
the British Parliament authorized the Tea Act. The act continued the tax
on teas and made the East India Company the sole legal supplier of tea
to the American colonies. By November, the citizens of Boston had had
enough. They refused to permit the unloading of tea, citing their main
complaint: "No taxation without representation." Several newspapers,
including *The Massachusetts Gazette*, warned arriving tea-bearing
ships, "We are prepared, and shall not fail to pay them an unwelcome
visit by The Mohawks."

Step forward in time to 1860---the eve of the American Civil War---to
another near monopoly supplier of historical significance: the U.S.
cotton industry. At that time, the Southern states provided the majority
of the cotton Britain imported. The South, wanting to secede from the
Union, hoped to leverage Britain's high dependency on its cotton into
formal diplomatic recognition of the Confederate States of America.

This leads us to this chapter\'s topic: a firm that controls all (or
nearly all) of the supply of a good or service---a monopoly. How do
monopoly firms behave in the marketplace? Do they have "power?" Does
this power potentially have unintended consequences? We'll return to
this case at the end of the chapter to see how the tea and cotton
monopolies influenced U.S. history.

Many believe that top executives at firms are the strongest supporters
of market competition, but this belief is far from the truth. Think
about it this way: If you very much wanted to win an Olympic gold medal,
would you rather be far better than everyone else, or locked in
competition with many athletes just as good as you? Similarly, if you
would like to attain a very high level of profits, would you rather
manage a business with little or no competition, or struggle against
many tough competitors who are trying to sell to your customers? By now,
you might have read the chapter on [Perfect
Competition](http://openstax.org/books/principles-microeconomics-3e/pages/8-introduction-to-perfect-competition).
In this chapter, we explore the opposite extreme: monopoly.

If perfect competition is a market where firms have no market power and
they simply respond to the market price, monopoly is a market with no
competition at all, and firms have a great deal of market power. In the
case of monopoly, one firm produces all of the output in a market. Since
a monopoly faces no significant competition, it can charge any price it
wishes, subject to the demand curve. While a monopoly, by definition,
refers to a single firm, in practice people often use the term to
describe a market in which one firm merely has a very high market share.
This tends to be the definition that the U.S. Department of Justice
uses.

Even though there are very few true monopolies in existence, we do deal
with some of those few every day, often without realizing it: The U.S.
Postal Service, your electric, and garbage collection companies are a
few examples. Some new drugs are produced by only one pharmaceutical
firm---and no close substitutes for that drug may exist.

From the mid-1990s until 2004, the U.S. Department of Justice prosecuted
the Microsoft Corporation for including Internet Explorer as the default
web browser with its operating system. The Justice Department's argument
was that, since Microsoft possessed an extremely high market share in
the industry for operating systems, the inclusion of a free web browser
constituted unfair competition to other browsers, such as Netscape
Navigator. Since nearly everyone was using Windows, including Internet
Explorer eliminated the incentive for consumers to explore other
browsers and made it impossible for competitors to gain a foothold in
the market. In 2013, the Windows system ran on more than 90% of the most
commonly sold personal computers. In 2015, a U.S. federal court tossed
out antitrust charges that Google had an agreement with mobile device
makers to set Google as the default search engine.

This chapter begins by describing how monopolies are protected from
competition, including laws that prohibit competition, technological
advantages, and certain configurations of demand and supply. It then
discusses how a monopoly will choose its profit-maximizing quantity to
produce and what price to charge. While a monopoly must be concerned
about whether consumers will purchase its products or spend their money
on something altogether different, the monopolist need not worry about
the actions of other competing firms producing its products. As a
result, a monopoly is not a price taker like a perfectly competitive
firm, but instead exercises some power to choose its market price.
