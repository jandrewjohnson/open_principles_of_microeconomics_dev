### 10.1 Monopolistic Competition

#### Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

-   Explain the significance of differentiated products
-   Describe how a monopolistic competitor chooses price and quantity
-   Discuss entry, exit, and efficiency as they pertain to monopolistic
    competition
-   Analyze how advertising can impact monopolistic competition

Monopolistic competition involves many firms competing against each
other, but selling products that are distinctive in some way. Examples
include stores that sell different styles of clothing; restaurants or
grocery stores that sell a variety of food; and even products like golf
balls or beer that may be at least somewhat similar but differ in public
perception because of advertising and brand names. There are over
600,000 restaurants in the United States. When products are distinctive,
each firm has a mini-monopoly on its particular style or flavor or brand
name. However, firms producing such products must also compete with
other styles and flavors and brand names. The term "monopolistic
competition" captures this mixture of mini-monopoly and tough
competition, and the following Clear It Up feature introduces its
derivation.

##### Who invented the theory of imperfect competition? {#who-invented-the-theory-of-imperfect-competition .Heading4Grey}

Two economists independently but simultaneously developed the theory of
imperfect competition in 1933. The first was Edward Chamberlin of
Harvard University who published *The Economics of Monopolistic
Competition*. The second was Joan Robinson of Cambridge University who
published *The Economics of Imperfect Competition*. Robinson
subsequently became interested in macroeconomics and she became a
prominent Keynesian, and later a post-Keynesian economist. (See the
[Welcome to
Economics!](http://openstax.org/books/principles-microeconomics-3e/pages/1-introduction)
and [The Keynesian
Perspective](http://openstax.org/books/principles-economics-3e/pages/25-introduction-to-the-keynesian-perspective)
chapters for more on Keynes.)

#### Differentiated Products

A firm can try to make its products different from those of its
competitors in several ways: physical aspects of the product, location
from which it sells the product, intangible aspects of the product, and
perceptions of the product. We call products that are distinctive in one
of these ways differentiated products.

Physical aspects of a product include all the phrases you hear in
advertisements: unbreakable bottle, nonstick surface,
freezer-to-microwave, non-shrink, extra spicy, newly redesigned for your
comfort. A firm\'s location can also create a difference between
producers. For example, a gas station located at a heavily traveled
intersection can probably sell more gas, because more cars drive by that
corner. A supplier to an automobile manufacturer may find that it is an
advantage to locate close to the car factory.

Intangible aspects can differentiate a product, too. Some intangible
aspects may be promises like a guarantee of satisfaction or money back,
a reputation for high quality, services like free delivery, or offering
a loan to purchase the product. Finally, product differentiation may
occur in the minds of buyers. For example, many people could not tell
the difference in taste between common varieties of ketchup or
mayonnaise if they were blindfolded but, because of past habits and
advertising, they have strong preferences for certain brands.
Advertising can play a role in shaping these intangible preferences.

The concept of differentiated products is closely related to the degree
of variety that is available. If everyone in the economy wore only blue
jeans, ate only white bread, and drank only tap water, then the markets
for clothing, food, and drink would be much closer to perfectly
competitive. The variety of styles, flavors, locations, and
characteristics creates product differentiation and monopolistic
competition.

#### Perceived Demand for a Monopolistic Competitor

A monopolistically competitive firm perceives a demand for its goods
that is an intermediate case between monopoly and competition. [Figure
10.2](#CNX_Econ_C10_008) offers a reminder that the demand curve that a
perfectly competitive firm faces is perfectly elastic or flat, because
the perfectly competitive firm can sell any quantity it wishes at the
prevailing market price. In contrast, the demand curve, as faced by a
monopolist, is the market demand curve, since a monopolist is the only
firm in the market, and hence is downward sloping.

![](media/10-1-monopolistic-competition_rId33.jpeg){width="6.5in" height="2.305in"}

Figure 10.2 Perceived Demand for Firms in Different Competitive Settings
The demand curve that a perfectly competitive firm faces is perfectly
elastic, meaning it can sell all the output it wishes at the prevailing
market price. The demand curve that a monopoly faces is the market
demand. It can sell more output only by decreasing the price it charges.
The demand curve that a monopolistically competitive firm faces falls in
between.

The demand curve as a monopolistic competitor faces is not flat, but
rather downward-sloping, which means that the monopolistic competitor
can raise its price without losing all of its customers or lower the
price and gain more customers. Since there are substitutes, the demand
curve facing a monopolistically competitive firm is more elastic than
that of a monopoly where there are no close substitutes. If a monopolist
raises its price, some consumers will choose not to purchase its
product---but they will then need to buy a completely different product.
However, when a monopolistic competitor raises its price, some consumers
will choose not to purchase the product at all, but others will choose
to buy a similar product from another firm. If a monopolistic competitor
raises its price, it will not lose as many customers as would a
perfectly competitive firm, but it will lose more customers than would a
monopoly that raised its prices.

At a glance, the demand curves that a monopoly and a monopolistic
competitor face look similar---that is, they both slope down. However,
the underlying economic meaning of these perceived demand curves is
different, because a monopolist faces the market demand curve and a
monopolistic competitor does not. Rather, a monopolistically competitive
firm's demand curve is but one of many firms that make up the "before"
market demand curve. Are you following? If so, how would you categorize
the market for golf balls? Take a swing, then see the following Clear It
Up feature.

#### Clear It Up {#clear-it-up-1 .Heading3Grey}

##### Are golf balls really differentiated products? {#are-golf-balls-really-differentiated-products .Heading4Grey}

Monopolistic competition refers to an industry that has more than a few
firms, each offering a product which, from the consumer's perspective,
is different from its competitors. The U.S. Golf Association runs a
laboratory that tests 20,000 golf balls a year. There are strict rules
for what makes a golf ball legal. A ball\'s weight cannot exceed 1.620
ounces and its diameter cannot be less than 1.680 inches (which is a
weight of 45.93 grams and a diameter of 42.67 millimeters, in case you
were wondering). The Association also tests the balls by hitting them at
different speeds. For example, the distance test involves having a
mechanical golfer hit the ball with a titanium driver and a swing speed
of 120 miles per hour. As the testing center explains: "The USGA system
then uses an array of sensors that accurately measure the flight of a
golf ball during a short, indoor trajectory from a ball launcher. From
this flight data, a computer calculates the lift and drag forces that
are generated by the speed, spin, and dimple pattern of the ball. \...
The distance limit is 317 yards."

Over 1800 golf balls made by more than 100 companies meet the USGA
standards. The balls do differ in various ways, such as the pattern of
dimples on the ball, the types of plastic on the cover and in the cores,
and other factors. Since all balls need to conform to the USGA tests,
they are much more alike than different. In other words, golf ball
manufacturers are monopolistically competitive.

However, retail sales of golf balls are about \$500 million per year,
which means that many large companies have a powerful incentive to
persuade players that golf balls are highly differentiated and that it
makes a huge difference which one you choose. Sure, Tiger Woods can tell
the difference. For the average amateur golfer who plays a few times a
summer---and who loses many golf balls to the woods and lake and needs
to buy new ones---most golf balls are pretty much indistinguishable.

#### How a Monopolistic Competitor Chooses Price and Quantity

The monopolistically competitive firm decides on its profit-maximizing
quantity and price in much the same way as a monopolist. A monopolistic
competitor, like a monopolist, faces a downward-sloping demand curve,
and so it will choose some combination of price and quantity along its
perceived demand curve.

As an example of a profit-maximizing monopolistic competitor, consider
the Authentic Chinese Pizza store, which serves pizza with cheese, sweet
and sour sauce, and your choice of vegetables and meats. Although
Authentic Chinese Pizza must compete against other pizza businesses and
restaurants, it has a differentiated product. The firm's perceived
demand curve is downward sloping, as [Figure 10.3](#CNX_Econ_C10_004)
shows and the first two columns of [Table 10.1](#Table_10_01).

![](media/10-1-monopolistic-competition_rId40.jpeg){width="4.88in" height="2.755in"}

Figure 10.3 How a Monopolistic Competitor Chooses its Profit Maximizing
Output and Price To maximize profits, the Authentic Chinese Pizza shop
would choose a quantity where marginal revenue equals marginal cost, or
Q where MR = MC. Here it would choose a quantity of 40 and a price of
\$16.

Table 10.1 Revenue and Cost Schedule

We can multiply the combinations of price and quantity at each point on
the demand curve to calculate the total revenue that the firm would
receive, which is in the third column of [Table 10.1](#Table_10_01). We
calculate marginal revenue, in the fourth column, as the change in total
revenue divided by the change in quantity. The final columns of [Table
10.1](#Table_10_01) show total cost, marginal cost, and average cost. As
always, we calculate marginal cost by dividing the change in total cost
by the change in quantity, while we calculate average cost by dividing
total cost by quantity. The following Work It Out feature shows how
these firms calculate how much of their products to supply at what
price.

#### Work It Out {#work-it-out .Heading3Grey}

##### How a Monopolistic Competitor Determines How Much to Produce and at What Price {#how-a-monopolistic-competitor-determines-how-much-to-produce-and-at-what-price .Heading4Grey}

The process by which a monopolistic competitor chooses its
profit-maximizing quantity and price resembles closely how a monopoly
makes these decisions process. First, the firm selects the
profit-maximizing quantity to produce. Then the firm decides what price
to charge for that quantity.

Step 1. The monopolistic competitor determines its profit-maximizing
level of output. In this case, the Authentic Chinese Pizza company will
determine the profit-maximizing quantity to produce by considering its
marginal revenues and marginal costs. Two scenarios are possible:

-   If the firm is producing at a quantity of output where marginal
    revenue exceeds marginal cost, then the firm should keep expanding
    production, because each marginal unit is adding to profit by
    bringing in more revenue than its cost. In this way, the firm will
    produce up to the quantity where MR = MC.
-   If the firm is producing at a quantity where marginal costs exceed
    marginal revenue, then each marginal unit is costing more than the
    revenue it brings in, and the firm will increase its profits by
    reducing the quantity of output until MR = MC.

In this example, MR and MC intersect at a quantity of 40, which is the
profit-maximizing level of output for the firm.

Step 2. The monopolistic competitor decides what price to charge. When
the firm has determined its profit-maximizing quantity of output, it can
then look to its perceived demand curve to find out what it can charge
for that quantity of output. On the graph, we show this process as a
vertical line reaching up through the profit-maximizing quantity until
it hits the firm's perceived demand curve. For Authentic Chinese Pizza,
it should charge a price of \$16 per pizza for a quantity of 40.

Once the firm has chosen price and quantity, it's in a position to
calculate total revenue, total cost, and profit. At a quantity of 40,
the price of \$16 lies above the average cost curve, so the firm is
making economic profits. From [Table 10.1](#Table_10_01) we can see
that, at an output of 40, the firm's total revenue is \$640 and its
total cost is \$580, so profits are \$60. In [Figure
10.3](#CNX_Econ_C10_004), the firm's total revenues are the rectangle
with the quantity of 40 on the horizontal axis and the price of \$16 on
the vertical axis. The firm's total costs are the light shaded rectangle
with the same quantity of 40 on the horizontal axis but the average cost
of \$14.50 on the vertical axis. Profits are total revenues minus total
costs, which is the shaded area above the average cost curve.

Although the process by which a monopolistic competitor makes decisions
about quantity and price is similar to the way in which a monopolist
makes such decisions, two differences are worth remembering. First,
although both a monopolist and a monopolistic competitor face
downward-sloping demand curves, the monopolist's perceived demand curve
is the market demand curve, while the perceived demand curve for a
monopolistic competitor is based on the extent of its product
differentiation and how many competitors it faces. Second, a monopolist
is surrounded by barriers to entry and need not fear entry, but a
monopolistic competitor who earns profits must expect the entry of firms
with similar, but differentiated, products.

#### Monopolistic Competitors and Entry

If one monopolistic competitor earns positive economic profits, other
firms will be tempted to enter the market. A gas station with a great
location must worry that other gas stations might open across the street
or down the road---and perhaps the new gas stations will sell coffee or
have a carwash or some other attraction to lure customers. A successful
restaurant with a unique barbecue sauce must be concerned that other
restaurants will try to copy the sauce or offer their own unique
recipes. A laundry detergent with a great reputation for quality must
take note that other competitors may seek to build their own
reputations.

The entry of other firms into the same general market (like gas,
restaurants, or detergent) shifts the demand curve that a
monopolistically competitive firm faces. As more firms enter the market,
the quantity demanded at a given price for any particular firm will
decline, and the firm's perceived demand curve will shift to the left.
As a firm's perceived demand curve shifts to the left, its marginal
revenue curve will shift to the left, too. The shift in marginal revenue
will change the profit-maximizing quantity that the firm chooses to
produce, since marginal revenue will then equal marginal cost at a lower
quantity.

[Figure 10.4](#CNX_Econ_C10_009) (a) shows a situation in which a
monopolistic competitor was earning a profit with its original perceived
demand curve (D~0~). The intersection of the marginal revenue curve
(MR~0~) and marginal cost curve (MC) occurs at point S, corresponding to
quantity Q~0~, which is associated on the demand curve at point T with
price P~0~. The combination of price P~0~ and quantity Q~0~ lies above
the average cost curve, which shows that the firm is earning positive
economic profits.

![](media/10-1-monopolistic-competition_rId47.jpeg){width="6.5in" height="2.68in"}

Figure 10.4 Monopolistic Competition, Entry, and Exit (a) At P~0~ and
Q~0~, the monopolistically competitive firm in this figure is making a
positive economic profit. This is clear because if you follow the dotted
line above Q~0~, you can see that price is above average cost. Positive
economic profits attract competing firms to the industry, driving the
original firm's demand down to D~1~. At the new equilibrium quantity
(P~1~, Q~1~), the original firm is earning zero economic profits, and
entry into the industry ceases. In (b) the opposite occurs. At P~0~ and
Q~0~, the firm is losing money. If you follow the dotted line above
Q~0~, you can see that average cost is above price. Losses induce firms
to leave the industry. When they do, demand for the original firm rises
to D~1~, where once again the firm is earning zero economic profit.

Unlike a monopoly, with its high barriers to entry, a monopolistically
competitive firm with positive economic profits will attract
competition. When another competitor enters the market, the original
firm's perceived demand curve shifts to the left, from D~0~ to D~1~, and
the associated marginal revenue curve shifts from MR~0~ to MR~1~. The
new profit-maximizing output is Q~1~, because the intersection of the
MR~1~ and MC now occurs at point U. Moving vertically up from that
quantity on the new demand curve, the optimal price is at P~1~.

As long as the firm is earning positive economic profits, new
competitors will continue to enter the market, reducing the original
firm's demand and marginal revenue curves. The long-run equilibrium is
in the figure at point Y, where the firm's perceived demand curve
touches the average cost curve. When price is equal to average cost,
economic profits are zero. Thus, although a monopolistically competitive
firm may earn positive economic profits in the short term, the process
of new entry will drive down economic profits to zero in the long run.
Remember that zero economic profit is not equivalent to zero accounting
profit. A zero economic profit means the firm's accounting profit is
equal to what its resources could earn in their next best use. [Figure
10.4](#CNX_Econ_C10_009) (b) shows the reverse situation, where a
monopolistically competitive firm is originally losing money. The
adjustment to long-run equilibrium is analogous to the previous example.
The economic losses lead to firms exiting, which will result in
increased demand for this particular firm, and consequently lower
losses. Firms exit up to the point where there are no more losses in
this market, for example when the demand curve touches the average cost
curve, as in point Z.

Monopolistic competitors can make an economic profit or loss in the
short run, but in the long run, entry and exit will drive these firms
toward a zero economic profit outcome. However, the zero economic profit
outcome in monopolistic competition looks different from the zero
economic profit outcome in perfect competition in several ways relating
both to efficiency and to variety in the market.

#### Monopolistic Competition and Efficiency

The long-term result of entry and exit in a perfectly competitive market
is that all firms end up selling at the price level determined by the
lowest point on the average cost curve. This outcome is why perfect
competition displays productive efficiency: goods are produced at the
lowest possible average cost. However, in monopolistic competition, the
end result of entry and exit is that firms end up with a price that lies
on the downward-sloping portion of the average cost curve, not at the
very bottom of the AC curve. Thus, monopolistic competition will not be
productively efficient.

In a perfectly competitive market, each firm produces at a quantity
where price is set equal to marginal cost, both in the short and long
run. This outcome is why perfect competition displays allocative
efficiency: the social benefits of additional production, as measured by
the marginal benefit, which is the same as the price, equal the marginal
costs to society of that production. In a monopolistically competitive
market, the rule for maximizing profit is to set MR = MC---and price is
higher than marginal revenue, not equal to it because the demand curve
is downward sloping. When P \> MC, which is the outcome in a
monopolistically competitive market, the benefits to society of
providing additional quantity, as measured by the price that people are
willing to pay, exceed the marginal costs to society of producing those
units. A monopolistically competitive firm does not produce more, which
means that society loses the net benefit of those extra units. This is
the same argument we made about monopoly, but in this case the
allocative inefficiency will be smaller. Thus, a monopolistically
competitive industry will produce a lower quantity of a good and charge
a higher price for it than would a perfectly competitive industry. See
the following Clear It Up feature for more detail on the impact of
demand shifts.

#### Clear It Up {#clear-it-up-2 .Heading3Grey}

##### Why does a shift in perceived demand cause a shift in marginal revenue? {#why-does-a-shift-in-perceived-demand-cause-a-shift-in-marginal-revenue .Heading4Grey}

We use the combinations of price and quantity at each point on a firm's
perceived demand curve to calculate total revenue for each combination
of price and quantity. We then use this information on total revenue to
calculate marginal revenue, which is the change in total revenue divided
by the change in quantity. A change in perceived demand will change
total revenue at every quantity of output and in turn, the change in
total revenue will shift marginal revenue at each quantity of output.
Thus, when entry occurs in a monopolistically competitive industry, the
perceived demand curve for each firm will shift to the left, because a
smaller quantity will be demanded at any given price. Another way of
interpreting this shift in demand is to notice that, for each quantity
sold, the firm will charge a lower price. Consequently, the marginal
revenue will be lower for each quantity sold---and the marginal revenue
curve will shift to the left as well. Conversely, exit causes the
perceived demand curve for a monopolistically competitive firm to shift
to the right and the corresponding marginal revenue curve to shift
right, too.

A monopolistically competitive industry does not display productive or
allocative efficiency in either the short run, when firms are making
economic profits and losses, nor in the long run, when firms are earning
zero profits.

#### The Benefits of Variety and Product Differentiation

Even though monopolistic competition does not provide productive
efficiency or allocative efficiency, it does have benefits of its own.
Product differentiation is based on variety and innovation. Most people
would prefer to live in an economy with many kinds of clothes, foods,
and car styles; not in a world of perfect competition where everyone
will always wear blue jeans and white shirts, eat only spaghetti with
plain red sauce, and drive an identical model of car. Most people would
prefer to live in an economy where firms are struggling to figure out
ways of attracting customers by methods like friendlier service, free
delivery, guarantees of quality, variations on existing products, and a
better shopping experience.

Economists have struggled, with only partial success, to address the
question of whether a market-oriented economy produces the optimal
amount of variety. Critics of market-oriented economies argue that
society does not really need dozens of different athletic shoes or
breakfast cereals or automobiles. They argue that much of the cost of
creating such a high degree of product differentiation, and then of
advertising and marketing this differentiation, is socially
wasteful---that is, most people would be just as happy with a smaller
range of differentiated products produced and sold at a lower price.
Defenders of a market-oriented economy respond that if people do not
want to buy differentiated products or highly advertised brand names, no
one is forcing them to do so. Moreover, they argue that consumers
benefit substantially when firms seek short-term profits by providing
differentiated products. This controversy may never be fully resolved,
in part because deciding on the optimal amount of variety is very
difficult, and in part because the two sides often place different
values on what variety means for consumers. Read the following Clear It
Up feature for a discussion on the role that advertising plays in
monopolistic competition.

#### Clear It Up {#clear-it-up-3 .Heading3Grey}

##### How does advertising impact monopolistic competition? {#how-does-advertising-impact-monopolistic-competition .Heading4Grey}

The U.S. economy spent about \$180.12 billion on advertising in 2014,
according to eMarketer.com. Roughly one third of this was television
advertising, and another third was divided roughly equally between
internet, newspapers, and radio. The remaining third was divided between
direct mail, magazines, telephone directory yellow pages, and
billboards. Mobile devices are increasing the opportunities for
advertisers.

Advertising is all about explaining to people, or making people believe,
that the products of one firm are differentiated from another firm\'s
products. In the framework of monopolistic competition, there are two
ways to conceive of how advertising works: either advertising causes a
firm's perceived demand curve to become more inelastic (that is, it
causes the perceived demand curve to become steeper); or advertising
causes demand for the firm's product to increase (that is, it causes the
firm's perceived demand curve to shift to the right). In either case, a
successful advertising campaign may allow a firm to sell either a
greater quantity or to charge a higher price, or both, and thus increase
its profits.

However, economists and business owners have also long suspected that
much of the advertising may only offset other advertising. Economist A.
C. Pigou wrote the following back in 1920 in his book, *The Economics of
Welfare*:

### 10.2 Oligopoly

#### Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

-   Explain why and how oligopolies exist
-   Contrast collusion and competition
-   Interpret and analyze the prisoner's dilemma diagram
-   Evaluate the tradeoffs of imperfect competition

Many purchases that individuals make at the retail level are produced in
markets that are neither perfectly competitive, monopolies, nor
monopolistically competitive. Rather, they are oligopolies. Oligopoly
arises when a small number of large firms have all or most of the sales
in an industry. Examples of oligopoly abound and include the auto
industry, cable television, and commercial air travel. Oligopolistic
firms are like cats in a bag. They can either scratch each other to
pieces or cuddle up and get comfortable with one another. If
oligopolists compete hard, they may end up acting very much like perfect
competitors, driving down costs and leading to zero profits for all. If
oligopolists collude with each other, they may effectively act like a
monopoly and succeed in pushing up prices and earning consistently high
levels of profit. We typically characterize oligopolies by mutual
interdependence where various decisions such as output, price, and
advertising depend on other firm(s)\' decisions. Analyzing the choices
of oligopolistic firms about pricing and quantity produced involves
considering the pros and cons of competition versus collusion at a given
point in time.

#### Why Do Oligopolies Exist?

A combination of the barriers to entry that create monopolies and the
product differentiation that characterizes monopolistic competition can
create the setting for an oligopoly. For example, when a government
grants a patent for an invention to one firm, it may create a monopoly.
When the government grants patents to, for example, three different
pharmaceutical companies that each has its own drug for reducing high
blood pressure, those three firms may become an oligopoly.

Similarly, a natural monopoly will arise when the quantity demanded in a
market is only large enough for a single firm to operate at the minimum
of the long-run average cost curve. In such a setting, the market has
room for only one firm, because no smaller firm can operate at a low
enough average cost to compete, and no larger firm could sell what it
produced given the quantity demanded in the market.

Quantity demanded in the market may also be two or three times the
quantity needed to produce at the minimum of the average cost
curve---which means that the market would have room for only two or
three oligopoly firms (and they need not produce differentiated
products). Again, smaller firms would have higher average costs and be
unable to compete, while additional large firms would produce such a
high quantity that they would not be able to sell it at a profitable
price. This combination of economies of scale and market demand creates
the barrier to entry, which led to the Boeing-Airbus oligopoly (also
called a duopoly) for large passenger aircraft.

The product differentiation at the heart of monopolistic competition can
also play a role in creating oligopoly. For example, firms may need to
reach a certain minimum size before they are able to spend enough on
advertising and marketing to create a recognizable brand name. The
problem in competing with, say, Coca-Cola or Pepsi is not that producing
fizzy drinks is technologically difficult, but rather that creating a
brand name and marketing effort to equal Coke or Pepsi is an enormous
task.

#### Collusion or Competition?

When oligopoly firms in a certain market decide what quantity to produce
and what price to charge, they face a temptation to act as if they were
a monopoly. By acting together, oligopolistic firms can hold down
industry output, charge a higher price, and divide the profit among
themselves. When firms act together in this way to reduce output and
keep prices high, it is called collusion. A group of firms that have a
formal agreement to collude to produce the monopoly output and sell at
the monopoly price is called a cartel. See the following Clear It Up
feature for a more in-depth analysis of the difference between the two.

#### Clear It Up {#clear-it-up .Heading3Grey}

##### Collusion versus cartels: How to differentiate {#collusion-versus-cartels-how-to-differentiate .Heading4Grey}

In the United States, as well as many other countries, it is illegal for
firms to collude since collusion is anti-competitive behavior, which is
a violation of antitrust law. Both the Antitrust Division of the Justice
Department and the Federal Trade Commission have responsibilities for
preventing collusion in the United States.

The problem of enforcement is finding hard evidence of collusion.
Cartels are formal agreements to collude. Because cartel agreements
provide evidence of collusion, they are rare in the United States.
Instead, most collusion is tacit, where firms implicitly reach an
understanding that competition is bad for profits.

Economists have understood for a long time the desire of businesses to
avoid competing so that they can instead raise the prices that they
charge and earn higher profits. Adam Smith wrote in *Wealth of Nations*
in 1776: "People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for
merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy
against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices."

Even when oligopolists recognize that they would benefit as a group by
acting like a monopoly, each individual oligopoly faces a private
temptation to produce just a slightly higher quantity and earn slightly
higher profit---while still counting on the other oligopolists to hold
down their production and keep prices high. If at least some
oligopolists give in to this temptation and start producing more, then
the market price will fall. A small handful of oligopoly firms may end
up competing so fiercely that they all find themselves earning zero
economic profits---as if they were perfect competitors.

#### The Prisoner's Dilemma

Because of the complexity of oligopoly, which is the result of mutual
interdependence among firms, there is no single, generally-accepted
theory of how oligopolies behave, in the same way that we have theories
for all the other market structures. Instead, economists use game
theory, a branch of mathematics that analyzes situations in which
players must make decisions and then receive payoffs based on what other
players decide to do. Game theory has found widespread applications in
the social sciences, as well as in business, law, and military strategy.

The prisoner's dilemma is a scenario in which the gains from cooperation
are larger than the rewards from pursuing self-interest. It applies well
to oligopoly. (Note that the term \"prisoner\" is not typically an
accurate term for someone who has recently been arrested, but we will
use the term here, since this scenario is widely used and referenced in
economic, business, and social contexts.) The story behind the
prisoner's dilemma goes like this:

> Two co-conspirators are arrested. When they are taken to the police
> station, they refuse to say anything and are put in separate
> interrogation rooms. Eventually, a police officer enters the room
> where Prisoner A is being held and says: "You know what? Your partner
> in the other room is confessing. Your partner is going to get a light
> prison sentence of just one year, and because you're remaining silent,
> the judge is going to stick you with eight years in prison. Why don't

The game theory situation facing the two prisoners is in [Table
10.2](#Table_10_03). To understand the dilemma, first consider the
choices from Prisoner A's point of view. If A believes that B will
confess, then A should confess, too, so as to not get stuck with the
eight years in prison. However, if A believes that B will not confess,
then A will be tempted to act selfishly and confess, so as to serve only
one year. The key point is that A has an incentive to confess regardless
of what choice B makes! B faces the same set of choices, and thus will
have an incentive to confess regardless of what choice A makes. To
confess is called the dominant strategy. It is the strategy an
individual (or firm) will pursue regardless of the other individual's
(or firm's) decision. The result is that if prisoners pursue their own
self-interest, both are likely to confess, and end up being sentenced to
a total of 10 years of jail time between them.

Table 10.2 The Prisoner's Dilemma Problem

The game is called a dilemma because if the two prisoners had cooperated
by both remaining silent, they would only have been incarcerated for two
years each, for a total of four years between them. If the two prisoners
can work out some way of cooperating so that neither one will confess,
they will both be better off than if they each follow their own
individual self-interest, which in this case leads straight into longer
terms.

#### The Oligopoly Version of the Prisoner's Dilemma

The members of an oligopoly can face a prisoner's dilemma, also. If each
of the oligopolists cooperates in holding down output, then high
monopoly profits are possible. Each oligopolist, however, must worry
that while it is holding down output, other firms are taking advantage
of the high price by raising output and earning higher profits. [Table
10.3](#Table_10_04) shows the prisoner's dilemma for a two-firm
oligopoly---known as a duopoly. If Firms A and B both agree to hold down
output, they are acting together as a monopoly and will each earn
\$1,000 in profits. However, both firms' dominant strategy is to
increase output, in which case each will earn \$400 in profits.

Table 10.3 A Prisoner's Dilemma for Oligopolists

Can the two firms trust each other? Consider the situation of Firm A:

-   If A thinks that B will cheat on their agreement and increase
    output, then A will increase output, too, because for A the profit
    of \$400 when both firms increase output (the bottom right-hand
    choice in [Table 10.3](#Table_10_04)) is better than a profit of
    only \$200 if A keeps output low and B raises output (the upper
    right-hand choice in the table).
-   If A thinks that B will cooperate by holding down output, then A may
    seize the opportunity to earn higher profits by raising output.
    After all, if B is going to hold down output, then A can earn
    \$1,500 in profits by expanding output (the bottom left-hand choice
    in the table) compared with only \$1,000 by holding down output as
    well (the upper left-hand choice in the table).

Thus, firm A will reason that it makes sense to expand output if B holds
down output and that it also makes sense to expand output if B raises
output. Again, B faces a parallel set of decisions that will lead B also
to expand output.

The result of this prisoner's dilemma is often that even though A and B
could make the highest combined profits by cooperating in producing a
lower level of output and acting like a monopolist, the two firms may
well end up in a situation where they each increase output and earn only
\$400 each in profits. The following Clear It Up feature discusses one
cartel scandal in particular.

#### Clear It Up {#clear-it-up-1 .Heading3Grey}

##### What is the Lysine cartel? {#what-is-the-lysine-cartel .Heading4Grey}

Lysine, a \$600 million-a-year industry, is an amino acid that farmers
use as a feed additive to ensure the proper growth of swine and poultry.
The primary U.S. producer of lysine is Archer Daniels Midland (ADM), but
several other large European and Japanese firms are also in this market.
For a time in the first half of the 1990s, the world's major lysine
producers met together in hotel conference rooms and decided exactly how
much each firm would sell and what it would charge. The U.S. Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI), however, had learned of the cartel and
placed wire taps on a number of their phone calls and meetings.

From FBI surveillance tapes, following is a comment that Terry Wilson,
president of the corn processing division at ADM, made to the other
lysine producers at a 1994 meeting in Mona, Hawaii:

> I wanna go back and I wanna say something very simple. If we're going
> to trust each other, okay, and if I'm assured that I'm gonna get
> 67,000 tons by the year's end, we're gonna sell it at the prices we
> agreed to . . . The only thing we need to talk about there because we
> are gonna get manipulated by these \[expletive\] buyers---they can be
> smarter than us if we let them be smarter. . . . They \[the
> customers\] are not your friend. They are not my friend. And we gotta
> have 'em, but they are not my friends. You are my friend. I wanna be
> closer to you than I am to any customer. Cause you can make us \...
> money. \... And all I wanna tell you again is let's---let's put the
> prices on the board. Let's all agree that's what we're gonna do and
> then walk out of here and do it.

The price of lysine doubled while the cartel was in effect. Confronted
by the FBI tapes, Archer Daniels Midland pled guilty in 1996 and paid a
fine of \$100 million. A number of top executives, both at ADM and other
firms, later paid fines of up to \$350,000 and were sentenced to 24--30
months in prison.

In another one of the FBI recordings, the president of Archer Daniels
Midland told an executive from another competing firm that ADM had a
slogan that, in his words, had "penetrated the whole company." The
company president stated the slogan this way: "Our competitors are our
friends. Our customers are the enemy." That slogan could stand as the
motto of cartels everywhere.

#### How to Enforce Cooperation

How can parties who find themselves in a prisoner's dilemma situation
avoid the undesired outcome and cooperate with each other? The way out
of a prisoner's dilemma is to find a way to penalize those who do not
cooperate.

Perhaps the easiest approach for colluding oligopolists, as you might
imagine, would be to sign a contract with each other that they will hold
output low and keep prices high. If a group of U.S. companies signed
such a contract, however, it would be illegal. Certain international
organizations, like the nations that are members of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), have signed international
agreements to act like a monopoly, hold down output, and keep prices
high so that all of the countries can make high profits from oil
exports. Such agreements, however, because they fall in a gray area of
international law, are not legally enforceable. If Nigeria, for example,
decides to start cutting prices and selling more oil, Saudi Arabia
cannot sue Nigeria in court and force it to stop.

#### Link It Up {#link-it-up .Heading3Grey}

Visit the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries
[website](http://openstax.org/l/OPEC) and learn more about its history
and how it defines itself.

Because oligopolists cannot sign a legally enforceable contract to act
like a monopoly, the firms may instead keep close tabs on what other
firms are producing and charging. Alternatively, oligopolists may choose
to act in a way that generates pressure on each firm to stick to its
agreed quantity of output.

One example of the pressure these firms can exert on one another is the
kinked demand curve, in which competing oligopoly firms commit to match
price cuts, but not price increases. [Figure 10.5](#CNX_Econ_C10_007)
shows this situation. Say that an oligopoly airline has agreed with the
rest of a cartel to provide a quantity of 10,000 seats on the New York
to Los Angeles route, at a price of \$500. This choice defines the kink
in the firm's perceived demand curve. The reason that the firm faces a
kink in its demand curve is because of how the other oligopolists react
to changes in the firm's price. If the oligopoly decides to produce more
and cut its price, the other members of the cartel will immediately
match any price cuts---and therefore, a lower price brings very little
increase in quantity sold.

If one firm cuts its price to \$300, it will be able to sell only 11,000
seats. However, if the airline seeks to raise prices, the other
oligopolists will not raise their prices, and so the firm that raised
prices will lose a considerable share of sales. For example, if the firm
raises its price to \$550, its sales drop to 5,000 seats sold. Thus, if
oligopolists always match price cuts by other firms in the cartel, but
do not match price increases, then none of the oligopolists will have a
strong incentive to change prices, since the potential gains are
minimal. This strategy can work like a silent form of cooperation, in
which the cartel successfully manages to hold down output, increase
price, and share a monopoly level of profits even without any legally
enforceable agreement.

![](media/10-2-oligopoly_rId51.jpeg){width="3.25in" height="2.465in"}

Figure 10.5 A Kinked Demand Curve Consider a member firm in an oligopoly
cartel that is supposed to produce a quantity of 10,000 and sell at a
price of \$500. The other members of the cartel can encourage this firm
to honor its commitments by acting so that the firm faces a kinked
demand curve. If the oligopolist attempts to expand output and reduce
price slightly, other firms also cut prices immediately---so if the firm
expands output to 11,000, the price per unit falls dramatically, to
\$300. On the other side, if the oligopoly attempts to raise its price,
other firms will not do so, so if the firm raises its price to \$550,
its sales decline sharply to 5,000. Thus, the members of a cartel can
discipline each other to stick to the pre-agreed levels of quantity and
price through a strategy of matching all price cuts but not matching any
price increases.

Many real-world oligopolies, prodded by economic changes, legal and
political pressures, and the egos of their top executives, go through
episodes of cooperation and competition. If oligopolies could sustain
cooperation with each other on output and pricing, they could earn
profits as if they were a single monopoly. However, each firm in an
oligopoly has an incentive to produce more and grab a bigger share of
the overall market; when firms start behaving in this way, the market
outcome in terms of prices and quantity can be similar to that of a
highly competitive market.

#### Tradeoffs of Imperfect Competition

Monopolistic competition is probably the single most common market
structure in the U.S. economy. It provides powerful incentives for
innovation, as firms seek to earn profits in the short run, while entry
assures that firms do not earn economic profits in the long run.
However, monopolistically competitive firms do not produce at the lowest
point on their average cost curves. In addition, the endless search to
impress consumers through product differentiation may lead to excessive
social expenses on advertising and marketing.

Oligopoly is probably the second most common market structure. When
oligopolies result from patented innovations or from taking advantage of
economies of scale to produce at low average cost, they may provide
considerable benefit to consumers. Oligopolies are often buffered by
significant barriers to entry, which enable the oligopolists to earn
sustained profits over long periods of time. Oligopolists also do not
typically produce at the minimum of their average cost curves. When they
lack vibrant competition, they may lack incentives to provide innovative
products and high-quality service.

The task of public policy with regard to competition is to sort through
these multiple realities, attempting to encourage behavior that is
beneficial to the broader society and to discourage behavior that only
adds to the profits of a few large companies, with no corresponding
benefit to consumers. [Monopoly and Antitrust
Policy](http://openstax.org/books/principles-microeconomics-3e/pages/11-introduction-to-monopoly-and-antitrust-policy)
discusses the delicate judgments that go into this task.

#### Bring It Home {#bring-it-home .Heading3Grey}

##### The Temptation to Defy the Law {#the-temptation-to-defy-the-law .Heading4Grey}

Oligopolistic firms have been called "cats in a bag," as this chapter
mentioned. The French detergent makers chose to "cozy up" with each
other. The result? An uneasy and tenuous relationship. When the *Wall
Street Journal* reported on the matter, it wrote: "According to a
statement a Henkel manager made to the \[French anti-trust\] commission,
the detergent makers wanted 'to limit the intensity of the competition
between them and clean up the market.' Nevertheless, by the early 1990s,
a price war had broken out among them." During the soap executives'
meetings, sometimes lasting more than four hours, the companies
established complex pricing structures. "One \[soap\] executive recalled
'chaotic' meetings as each side tried to work out how the other had bent
the rules." Like many cartels, the soap cartel disintegrated due to the
very strong temptation for each member to maximize its own individual
profits.

How did this soap opera end? After an investigation, French antitrust
authorities fined Colgate-Palmolive, Henkel, and Proctor & Gamble a
total of €361 million (\$484 million). A similar fate befell the
icemakers. Bagged ice is a commodity, a perfect substitute, generally
sold in 7- or 22-pound bags. No one cares what label is on the bag. By
agreeing to carve up the ice market, control broad geographic swaths of
territory, and set prices, the icemakers moved from perfect competition
to a monopoly model. After the agreements, each firm was the sole
supplier of bagged ice to a region. There were profits in both the long
run and the short run. According to the courts: "These companies
illegally conspired to manipulate the marketplace." Fines totaled about
\$600,000---a steep fine considering a bag of ice sells for under \$3 in
most parts of the United States.

Even though it is illegal in many parts of the world for firms to set
prices and carve up a market, the temptation to earn higher profits
makes it extremely tempting to defy the law.

##### The Temptation to Defy the Law {#the-temptation-to-defy-the-law .Heading4Grey}

Laundry detergent and bags of ice---products of industries that seem
pretty mundane, maybe even boring. Hardly! Both have been the center of
clandestine meetings and secret deals worthy of a spy novel. In France,
between 1997 and 2004, the top four laundry detergent producers (Proctor
& Gamble, Henkel, Unilever, and Colgate-Palmolive) controlled about 90
percent of the French soap market. Officials from the soap firms were
meeting secretly, in out-of-the-way, small cafés around Paris. Their
goals: Stamp out competition and set prices.

Around the same time, the top five Midwest ice makers (Home City Ice,
Lang Ice, Tinley Ice, Sisler's Dairy, and Products of Ohio) had similar
goals in mind when they secretly agreed to divide up the bagged ice
market.

If both groups could meet their goals, it would enable each to act as
though they were a single firm---in essence, a monopoly---and enjoy
monopoly-size profits. The problem? In many parts of the world,
including the European Union and the United States, it is illegal for
firms to divide markets and set prices collaboratively.

These two cases provide examples of markets that are characterized
neither as perfect competition nor monopoly. Instead, these firms are
competing in market structures that lie between the extremes of monopoly
and perfect competition. How do they behave? Why do they exist? We will
revisit this case later, to find out what happened.

Perfect competition and monopoly are at opposite ends of the competition
spectrum. A perfectly competitive market has many firms selling
identical products, who all act as price takers in the face of the
competition. If you recall, price takers are firms that have no market
power. They simply have to take the market price as given.

Monopoly arises when a single firm sells a product for which there are
no close substitutes. We consider Microsoft, for instance, as a monopoly
because it dominates the operating systems market.

What about the vast majority of real world firms and organizations that
fall between these extremes, firms that we could describe as imperfectly
competitive? What determines their behavior? They have more influence
over the price they charge than perfectly competitive firms, but not as
much as a monopoly. What will they do?

One type of imperfectly competitive market is monopolistic competition.
Monopolistically competitive markets feature a large number of competing
firms, but the products that they sell are not identical. Consider, as
an example, the Mall of America in Minnesota, the largest shopping mall
in the United States. In 2010, the Mall of America had 24 stores that
sold women's "ready-to-wear" clothing (like Ann Taylor and Urban
Outfitters), another 50 stores that sold clothing for both men and women
(like Banana Republic, J. Crew, and Nordstrom's), plus 14 more stores
that sold women's specialty clothing (like Motherhood Maternity and
Victoria's Secret). Most of the markets that consumers encounter at the
retail level are monopolistically competitive.

The other type of imperfectly competitive market is oligopoly.
Oligopolistic markets are those which a small number of firms dominate.
Commercial aircraft provides a good example: Boeing and Airbus each
produce slightly less than 50% of the large commercial aircraft in the
world. Another example is the U.S. soft drink industry, which Coca-Cola
and Pepsi dominate. We characterize oligopolies by high barriers to
entry with firms choosing output, pricing, and other decisions
strategically based on the decisions of the other firms in the market.
In this chapter, we first explore how monopolistically competitive firms
will choose their profit-maximizing level of output. We will then
discuss oligopolistic firms, which face two conflicting temptations: to
collaborate as if they were a single monopoly, or to individually
compete to gain profits by expanding output levels and cutting prices.
Oligopolistic markets and firms can also take on elements of monopoly
and of perfect competition.
