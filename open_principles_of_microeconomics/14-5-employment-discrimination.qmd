## 14.5 Employment Discrimination

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

-   Analyze earnings gaps based on race and gender
-   Explain the impact of discrimination in a competitive market
-   Identify U.S. public policies designed to reduce discrimination

Barriers to equitable participation in the labor market drive down
economic growth. When certain populations are underrepresented,
underpaid, or mistreated in a labor market or industry, the negative
outcomes can effect the larger economy. For example, many science and
technology fields were either unwelcoming or overtly unaccepting of
women and people of color. Some major contributors to these fields
overcame these challenges. Mexican-American scientist Lydia
Villa-Komaroff, for example, faced overt discrimination when her college
advisor told her not to pursue chemistry because women didn\'t
\"belong\" in chemistry. She pursued biology instead; she developed the
first instance of synthetic insulin (the chemical that people with
diabetes need in order to survive) through a process that has saved
million of lives and is credited with launching the entire industry of
biotechnology---one of the most important in the U.S. economy. But for
every Villa-Komaroff, there have been thousands of women who were
prevented from making those contributions. Beyond the personal impact on
those people, consider the impact on those scientific fields, our
overall quality of life, and the economy itself. Economist Lisa D. Cook
has quantified the costs of these innovation losses. She estimates that
GDP could be as much as 4.4% higher if women and people from minority
populations were fully able to participate in the science and technology
innovation process.

Discrimination involves acting on the belief that members of a certain
group are inferior or deserve less solely because of a factor such as
race, gender, or religion. There are many types of discrimination but
the focus here will be on discrimination in labor markets, which arises
if workers with the same skill levels---as measured by education,
experience, and expertise---receive different pay or have different job
opportunities because of their race or gender. Much of the data
collected and published on these topics are limited in terms of the
diversity of people represented, and focus particularly on binary
gender, single-race, and single-ethnicity identities. While these
characterizations do not capture the diversity of Americans, the
findings are important in order to understand discrimination and other
practices, and to consider the impacts of policies and changes. Also,
while sex and gender are different, many data sets, laws, court
decisions, and media accounts use the terms interchangeably. For
consistency, we will use the terminology found in the source material
and government data.

### Earnings Gaps by Race and Gender

A possible signal of labor market discrimination is when an employer
pays one group less than another. [Figure 14.15](#CNX_Econ_C15_001)
shows the average wage of Black workers as a ratio of the average wage
of White workers and the average wage of female workers as a ratio of
the average wage of male workers. Research by the economists Francine
Blau and Laurence Kahn shows that the gap between the earnings of women
and men did not move much in the 1970s, but has declined since the
1980s. Detailed analysis by economists Kerwin Kofi Charles and Patrick
Bayer show that the gap between the earnings of Black and White people
diminished in the 1970s, but grew again so that current differences are
as wide as they were nearly 70 years ago. In both gender and race, an
earnings gap remains.

Figure 14.15 Wage Ratios by Sex and Race The ratio of wages for Black
workers to White workers rose substantially in the late 1960s and
through the 1970s. The 1990s saw a peak above 80% followed by a bumpy
decline to the low 70s. The ratio of wages for female to male workers
changed little through the 1970s. In both cases, a gap remains between
the average wages of Black and White workers and between the average
wages of female and male workers. Source: U.S. Department of Labor,
Bureau of Labor Statistics.

An earnings gap between average wages, in and of itself, does not prove
that discrimination is occurring in the labor market. We need to apply
the same productivity characteristics to all parties (employees)
involved. Gender discrimination in the labor market occurs when
employers pay people of a specific gender less despite those people
having comparable levels of education, experience, and expertise. (Read
the Clear It Up about the sex-discrimination suit brought against
Walmart.) Similarly, racial discrimination in the labor market exists
when employers pay racially diverse employees less than their coworkers
of the majority race despite having comparable levels of education,
experience, and expertise. To bring a successful gender discrimination
lawsuit, an employee must prove the employer is paying them less than an
employee of a different gender who holds a similar job, with similar
educational attainment, and with similar expertise. Likewise, someone
who wants to sue on the grounds of racial discrimination must prove that
the employer pays them less than an employee of another race who holds a
similar job, with similar educational attainment, and with similar
expertise.

The FRED database includes earnings data at [earnings by age, gender and
race/ethnicity](https://openstax.org/l/33501).

As stated previously and as we will see below, not every instance of a
wage gap or employment inequity is a product of overt discrimination on
the part of individual employers. Significant overall issues in
societies, such as inequitable education or housing segregation, can
lead to earning gaps and limitations on economic mobility. However,
these wider issues usually affect people from minority populations
and/or those who have been historically underrepresented in positions of
power. Economist William A. Darity Jr., whose work is discussed in more
detail below, indicates that individualized employer racism still
exists, but it is largely practiced in \"covert and subtle forms.\"

### Clear It Up {#clear-it-up .Heading3Grey}

#### What was the sex-discrimination case against Walmart? {#what-was-the-sex-discrimination-case-against-walmart .Heading4Grey}

In one of the largest class-action sex-discrimination cases in U.S.
history, 1.2 million female employees of Walmart claimed that the
company engaged in wage and promotion discrimination. In 2011, the
Supreme Court threw out the case on the grounds that the group was too
large and too diverse to consider the case a class action suit. Lawyers
for the women regrouped and were subsequently suing in smaller groups.
Part of the difficulty for the female employees is that the court said
that local managers made pay and promotion decisions that were not
necessarily the company\'s policies as a whole. Consequently, female
Walmart employees in Texas argued that their new suit would challenge
the management of a "discrete group of regional district and store
managers." They claimed that these managers made biased pay and
promotion decisions. However, in 2013, a federal district court rejected
a smaller California class action suit against the company.

On other issues, Walmart made the news again in 2013 when the National
Labor Relations Board found Walmart guilty of illegally penalizing and
firing workers who took part in labor protests and strikes. Walmart paid
\$11.7 million in back wages and compensation damages to women in
Kentucky who were denied jobs due to their sex. And in 2020, a sex-based
hiring discrimination lawsuit was filed by the U.S. Equal EmployÂ­ment
Opportunity Commission (EEOC), in which the EEOC alleged that Walmart
conducted a physical ability test (known as the PAT) as a requirement
for applicants to be hired as order fillers at Walmart's grocery
distribution centers nationwide, and that the PAT disproportionately
excluded female applicants from jobs as grocery order fillers. In
September 2020, Walmart and the EEOC agreed to a consent decree, which
requires Walmart to cease all physical ability testing that had been
used for purposes of hiring grocery distribution center order fillers.
The decree also required Walmart to pay \$20 million into a settlement
fund to pay lost wages to women across the country who were denied
grocery order filler positions because of the testing.

### Investigating the Female/Male Earnings Gap

As a result of changes in law and culture, women began to enter the paid
workforce in substantial numbers in the mid- to late-twentieth century.
As of February 2022, 56.0% of women aged 20 and over held jobs, while
67.6% of men aged 20 and over did. Moreover, along with entering the
workforce, women began to ratchet up their education levels. In 1971,
44% of undergraduate college degrees went to women. As of the 2018--19
academic year, women earned 57% of bachelor's degrees. In 1970, women
received 5.4% of the degrees from law schools and 8.4% of the degrees
from medical schools. By 2017, women were receiving just over 50% of the
law degrees, and by 2019, 48% of the medical degrees. There are now
slightly more women than men in both law schools and medical schools.
These gains in education and experience have reduced the female/male
wage gap over time. However, concerns remain about the extent to which
women have not yet assumed a substantial share of the positions at the
top of the largest companies or in the U.S. Congress.

There are factors that can lower women's average wages. Women are likely
to bear a disproportionately large share of household responsibilities.
A mother of young children is more likely to drop out of the labor force
for several years or work on a reduced schedule than is the father. As a
result, women in their 30s and 40s are likely, on average, to have less
job experience than men. In the United States, childless women with the
same education and experience levels as men are typically paid
comparably. However, women with families and children are typically paid
about 7% to 14% less than other women of similar education and work
experience. Meanwhile, married men earn about 10% to 15% more than
single men with comparable education and work experience. This
circumstance or practice is often referred to as the \"motherhood
penalty\" and the \"fatherhood bonus.\"

Another aspect of the gender pay gap relates to work that isn't actually
paid, such as household chores, caring for children and other family
members, and cooking. Studies have found that globally and within the
United States, women undertake far more of this work than do men; even
women who work full time and/or bring in the majority of family income
take on more of this unpaid work than the men in their households.

Economists study many aspects of sex- and gender-based earnings gaps,
often revealing unexpected causes and impacts. For example, economists
Jessica Pan, Jonathan Guryan, and Kerwin Kofi Charles analyzed decades
of sociological and employment data and uncovered that the amount of
sexism in the U.S. state where a woman was born is an indicator of the
woman\'s earnings throughout her life, even if she moves away from her
home state. In other words, women born in states with more pronounced
sexist attitudes earn less, no matter where they live later on. Other
economists showed that from 1950--2000, as women\'s representation
increased in the workforce, jobs that became occupied by women
experienced wage reductions relative to jobs being done by men---an
outcome often referred to as \"devaluation.\" The value of this research
and similar investigations comes from the deeper understanding of the
origins of the earnings gap, so that workers, employers, and governments
can take steps to address them.

### Investigating the Earnings Gap Related to Race and Ethnicity

Black people experienced blatant labor market discrimination during much
of the twentieth century. Until the passage of the Civil Rights Act of
1964, it was legal in many states to refuse to hire a Black worker,
regardless of the credentials or experience of that worker. Moreover,
Black people were often denied access to educational opportunities,
which in turn meant that they had lower levels of qualifications for
many jobs. At least one economic study has shown that the 1964 law is
partially responsible for the narrowing of the gap in Black--White
earnings in the late 1960s and into the 1970s. For example, the ratio of
total earnings of Black male workers to White male workers rose from 62%
in 1964 to 75.3% in 2013, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

However, the earnings gap between Black and White workers has not
changed as much as the earnings gap between men and women has in the
last half century. The remaining racial gap seems related both to
continuing differences in education levels and to the presence of
discrimination. [Table 14.9](#Table_15_06) shows that the percentage of
Black people who complete a four-year college degree remains
substantially lower than the percentage of White people who complete
college. According to the U.S. Census, both White and Black people have
higher levels of educational attainment than Hispanic people and lower
levels than Asian people. The lower average levels of education for
Black workers surely explain part of the earnings gap. In fact, Black
women who have the same levels of education and experience as White
women receive, on average, about the same level of pay. One study shows
that White and Black college graduates have identical salaries
immediately after college; however, the racial wage gap widens over
time, an outcome that suggests the possibility of continuing
discrimination. Other researchers conducted a field experiment by
responding to job advertisements with fictitious resumes using names
that were either commonly associated with Black/African American people
or names commonly associated with White people; they found that the
White-associated names received 50 percent more callbacks for
interviews. This is suggestive of discrimination in job opportunities.
Further, as the following Clear It Up feature explains, there is
evidence to support that discrimination in the housing market is
connected to employment discrimination.

### Clear It Up {#clear-it-up-1 .Heading3Grey}

#### How is discrimination in the housing market connected to employment discrimination? {#how-is-discrimination-in-the-housing-market-connected-to-employment-discrimination .Heading4Grey}

A recent study by the Housing and Urban Development (HUD) department
found that realtors showed Black homebuyers 18 percent fewer homes
compared to White homebuyers. Realtors showed Asian homebuyers 19
percent fewer properties. Additionally, Hispanic people experience more
discrimination in renting apartments and undergo stiffer credit checks
than White renters. In a 2012 study by the U.S. Department of Housing
and Urban Development and the nonprofit Urban Institute, Hispanic
testers who contacted agents about advertised rental units received
information about 12 percent fewer units available and were shown seven
percent fewer units than White renters. The \$9 million study, based on
research in 28 metropolitan areas, concluded that blatant "door
slamming" forms of discrimination are on the decline but that the
discrimination that does exist is harder to detect, and as a result,
more difficult to remedy. According to the *Chicago Tribune*, HUD
Secretary Shaun Donovan, who served in his role from 2009-2014, told
reporters, "Just because it's taken on a hidden form doesn't make it any
less harmful. You might not be able to move into that community with the
good schools."

These practices are viewed as a continuation of redlining, which is the
intentional and discriminatory withholding of services or products based
on race or other factors. Redlining was practiced extensively by banks
and other lenders who refused to issue mortgages or other loans to
people from racial or ethnic minorities living in neighborhoods that
were deemed \"hazardous\" to investment, even though the same lenders
would issue loans to White people with similar economic status.
Redlining has lasting effects today, demonstrated by significant divides
in educational and financial opportunity in certain neighborhoods or
cities.

The lower levels of education for Black workers can also be a result of
discrimination---although it may be pre-labor market discrimination,
rather than direct discrimination by employers in the labor market. For
example, if redlining and other discrimination in housing markets causes
Black families to live clustered together in certain neighborhoods and
those areas have under-resourced schools, then those children will
continue to have lower educational attainment then their White
counterparts and, consequently, not be able to obtain the higher paying
jobs that require higher levels of education. Another element to
consider is that in the past, when Black people were effectively barred
from many high-paying jobs, obtaining additional education could have
seemed not to be worth the investment, because the educational degrees
would not pay off. While the government has legally abolished
discriminatory labor practices, structures and systems take a very long
time to eradicate.

### Competitive Markets and Discrimination

Gary Becker (1930--2014), who won the Nobel Prize in economics in 1992,
was one of the first to analyze discrimination in economic terms. Becker
pointed out that while competitive markets can allow some employers to
practice discrimination, it can also provide profit-seeking firms with
incentives not to discriminate. Given these incentives, Becker explored
the question of why discrimination persists.

If a business is located in an area with a large minority population and
refuses to sell to minorities, it will cut into its own profits. If some
businesses run by bigoted employers refuse to pay women and/or
minorities a wage based on their productivity, then other profit-seeking
employers can hire these workers. In a competitive market, if the
business owners care more about the color of money than about the color
of skin, they will have an incentive to make buying, selling, hiring,
and promotion decisions strictly based on economic factors.

Do not underestimate the power of markets to offer at least a degree of
freedom to oppressed groups. In many countries, cohesive minority
population groups like Jewish people and emigrant Chinese people have
managed to carve out a space for themselves through their economic
activities, despite legal and social discrimination against them. Many
immigrants, including those who come to the United States, have taken
advantage of economic freedom to make new lives for themselves. However,
history teaches that market forces alone are unlikely to eliminate
discrimination. After all, discrimination against African Americans
persisted in the market-oriented U.S. economy during the century between
the ratification of the 13th Amendment, which abolished slavery in 1865,
and the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964---and has continued
since then, too.

Why does discrimination persist in competitive markets? Gary Becker
sought to explain this persistence. Discriminatory impulses can emerge
at a number of levels: among managers, among workers, and among
customers. Consider the situation of a store owner or manager who is not
personally prejudiced, but who has many customers who are prejudiced. If
that manager treats all groups fairly, the manager may find it drives
away prejudiced customers. In such a situation, a policy of
nondiscrimination could reduce the firm's profits. After all, a business
firm is part of society, and a firm that does not follow the societal
norms is likely to suffer.

As economist William A. Darity Jr. points out, however, the \"prejudiced
customer\" rationale falls apart when considering the many jobs that
have no customer contact. Darity examined several theories regarding the
persistence of employment discrimination, including rationales regarding
group membership and employers\' lack of information about candidates of
other genders or races. Darity also directly studies and interprets
others\' work on discrimination in other countries, such as wage
disparities between Sikh and Hindu men in India. Darity concludes that
the competitive forces of the market have not been enough to overcome
employment and wage discrimination, and, on their own, are unlikely to
end such discrimination in the future.

### Public Policies to Reduce Discrimination

A first public policy step against discrimination in the labor market is
to make it illegal. For example, the Equal Pay Act of 1963 said that
employers must pay men and women who do equal work the same. The Civil
Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employment discrimination based on race,
color, religion, sex, or national origin. The Age Discrimination in
Employment Act of 1967 prohibited discrimination on the basis of age
against individuals who are 40 years of age or older. The Civil Rights
Act of 1991 provides monetary damages in cases of intentional employment
discrimination. The Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 was aimed at
prohibiting discrimination against people in the workplace who are
planning pregnancy, are pregnant, or are returning after pregnancy.
Passing a law, however, is only part of the answer, since discrimination
by prejudiced employers may be less important than broader social
patterns and systems.

The 1964 Civil Rights Act created an important government organization,
the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, to investigate employment
discrimination and protect workers who filed complaints against
employers. Economist Phyllis Ann Wallace, who had previously worked for
U.S. intelligence services, was appointed as the commission\'s chief of
technical studies. In this role she collected and organized a massive
amount of public and private sector data, as well as mentored and
directed economists and other analysts in their investigations.

These laws against discrimination have reduced the gender wage gap. A
2007 Department of Labor study compared salaries of men and women who
have similar educational achievement, work experience, and occupation
and found that the gender wage gap is only 5%.

In the case of the earnings gap between Black people and White people
(and also between Hispanic people and White people), probably the single
largest step that could be taken at this point in U.S. history to close
the earnings gap would be to reduce the gap in educational attainment.
Part of the answer to this issue involves finding ways to improve the
performance of schools, which is a highly controversial topic in itself.
In addition, the education gap is unlikely to close unless Black and
Hispanic families and peer groups strengthen their culture of support
for educational attainment.

Affirmative action is the name given to active efforts by government or
businesses that give special rights to minorities in hiring and
promotion to make up for past discrimination. Affirmative action, in its
limited and not especially controversial form, means making an effort to
reach out to a broader range of minority candidates for jobs. In its
more aggressive and controversial form, affirmative action required
government and companies to hire a specific number or percentage of
minority employees. However, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled against
state affirmative action laws. Today, the government applies affirmative
action policies only to federal contractors who have lost a
discrimination lawsuit. The federal Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission (EEOC) enforces this type of redress.

### An Increasingly Diverse Workforce

Racial and ethnic diversity is on the rise in the U.S. population and
workforce. As [Figure 14.16](#CNX_Econ_C15_006) shows, while the White
Americans comprised 78% of the population in 2012, the U.S. Bureau of
the Census projects that Whites will comprise 69% of the U.S. population
by 2060. Forecasters predict that the proportion of U.S. citizens who
are of Hispanic background to rise substantially. Moreover, in addition
to expected changes in the population, workforce diversity is increasing
as the women who entered the workforce in the 1970s and 1980s are now
moving up the promotion ladders within their organizations.

population by 2060. Note that "NHPI" stands for Native Hawaiian and
Other Pacific Islander. "AIAN" stands for American Indian and Alaska
Native. Source: US Department of Commerce

Regarding the future, optimists argue that the growing proportions of
minority workers will break down remaining discriminatory barriers. The
economy will benefit as an increasing proportion of workers from
traditionally disadvantaged groups have a greater opportunity to fulfill
their potential. Pessimists worry that the social tensions between
different genders and between ethnic groups will rise and that workers
will be less productive as a result. Anti-discrimination policy, at its
best, seeks to help society move toward the more optimistic outcome.
