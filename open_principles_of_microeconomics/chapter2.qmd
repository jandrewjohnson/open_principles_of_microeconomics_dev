### Introduction to Choice in a World of Scarcity

#### Bring It Home {#bring-it-home .Heading3Grey}

##### Choices \... to What Degree? {#choices-...-to-what-degree .Heading4Grey}

Does your level of education impact earning? Let's look at some data
from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). In 2020, among full-time wage
and salary workers, median weekly earnings for those with a master's
degree were \$1,545. Multiply this average by 52 weeks, and you get
average annual earnings of \$80,340. Compare that to the median weekly
earnings for full-time workers aged 25 and over with just a bachelor's
degree: \$1,305 weekly and \$67,860 a year. What about those with no
higher than a high school diploma in 2020? They earn an average of just
\$781 weekly and \$40,612 over 12 months. In other words, data from the
BLS indicates that receiving a bachelor's degree boosts earnings by 67%
over what workers would have earned if they only obtained a high school
diploma, and a master's degree yields average earnings that are nearly
double those of workers with a high school diploma.

Given these statistics, we might expect many people to choose to go to
college and at least earn a bachelor's degree. Assuming that people want
to improve their material well-being, it seems like they would make
those choices that provide them with the greatest opportunity to consume
goods and services. As it turns out, the analysis is not nearly as
simple as this. In fact, in 2019, the BLS reported that while just over
90% of the population aged 25 and over in the United States had a high
school diploma, only 36% of those aged 25 and over had a bachelor\'s or
higher degree, and only 13.5% had earned a master\'s or higher degree.

This brings us to the subject of this chapter: why people make the
choices they make and how economists explain those choices.

You will learn quickly when you examine the relationship between
economics and scarcity that choices involve tradeoffs. Every choice has
a cost.

In 1968, the Rolling Stones recorded "You Can't Always Get What You
Want." Economists chuckled, because they had been singing a similar tune
for decades. English economist Lionel Robbins (1898--1984), in his
*Essay on the Nature and Significance of Economic Science* in 1932,
described not always getting what you want in this way:

> The time at our disposal is limited. There are only twenty-four hours
> in the day. We have to choose between the different uses to which they
> may be put. \... Everywhere we turn, if we choose one thing we must
> relinquish others which, in different circumstances, we would wish not
> to have relinquished. Scarcity of means to satisfy given ends is an
> almost ubiquitous condition of human nature.

Because people live in a world of scarcity, they cannot have all the
time, money, possessions, and experiences they wish. Neither can
society.

This chapter will continue our discussion of scarcity and the economic
way of thinking by first introducing three critical concepts:
opportunity cost, marginal decision making, and diminishing returns.
Later, it will consider whether the economic way of thinking accurately
describes either how we *make* choices and how we *should* make them.


### 2.1 How Individuals Make Choices Based on Their Budget Constraint

#### Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

-   Calculate and graph budget constraints
-   Explain opportunity sets and opportunity costs
-   Evaluate the law of diminishing marginal utility
-   Explain how marginal analysis and utility influence choices

Consider the typical consumer's budget problem. Consumers have a limited
amount of income to spend on the things they need and want. Suppose
Alphonso has \$10 in spending money each week that he can allocate
between bus tickets for getting to work and the burgers that he eats for
lunch. Burgers cost \$2 each, and bus tickets are 50 cents each. We can
see Alphonso\'s budget problem in [Figure 2.2](#fig-2_2).

![](media/2-1-how-individuals-make-choices-based-on-their-budget-constraint_rId22.jpeg){width="3.25in" height="1.445in" #fig-2_2}

Figure 2.2 The Budget Constraint: Alphonso's Consumption Choice
Opportunity Frontier Each point on the budget constraint represents a
combination of burgers and bus tickets whose total cost adds up to
Alphonso's budget of \$10. The relative price of burgers and bus tickets
determines the slope of the budget constraint. All along the budget set,
giving up one burger means gaining four bus tickets.

The vertical axis in the figure shows burger purchases and the
horizontal axis shows bus ticket purchases. If Alphonso spends all his
money on burgers, he can afford five per week. (\$10 per week/\$2 per
burger = 5 burgers per week.) However, if he does this, he will not be
able to afford any bus tickets. Point A in the figure shows the choice
(zero bus tickets and five burgers). Alternatively, if Alphonso spends
all his money on bus tickets, he can afford 20 per week. (\$10 per
week/\$0.50 per bus ticket = 20 bus tickets per week.) Then, however, he
will not be able to afford any burgers. Point F shows this alternative
choice (20 bus tickets and zero burgers).

If we connect all the points between A and F, we get Alphonso\'s budget
constraint. This indicates all the combination of burgers and bus
tickets Alphonso can afford, given the price of the two goods and his
budget amount.

If Alphonso is like most people, he will choose some combination that
includes both bus tickets and burgers. That is, he will choose some
combination on the budget constraint that is between points A and F.
Every point on (or inside) the constraint shows a combination of burgers
and bus tickets that Alphonso can afford. Any point outside the
constraint is not affordable, because it would cost more money than
Alphonso has in his budget.

The budget constraint clearly shows the tradeoff Alphonso faces in
choosing between burgers and bus tickets. Suppose he is currently at
point D, where he can afford 12 bus tickets and two burgers. What would
it cost Alphonso for one more burger? It would be natural to answer \$2,
but that's not the way economists think. Instead they ask, how many bus
tickets would Alphonso have to give up to get one more burger, while
staying within his budget? Since bus tickets cost 50 cents, Alphonso
would have to give up four to afford one more burger. That is the true
cost to Alphonso.

#### The Concept of Opportunity Cost

Economists use the term opportunity cost to indicate what people must
give up to obtain what they desire. The idea behind opportunity cost is
that the cost of one item is the lost opportunity to do or consume
something else. In short, opportunity cost is the value of the next best
alternative. For Alphonso, the opportunity cost of a burger is the four
bus tickets he would have to give up. He would decide whether or not to
choose the burger depending on whether the value of the burger exceeds
the value of the forgone alternative---in this case, bus tickets. Since
people must choose, they inevitably face tradeoffs in which they have to
give up things they desire to obtain other things they desire more.

#### Link It Up {#link-it-up .Heading3Grey}

View this [website](http://www.linestanding.com/) for an example
of opportunity cost---paying someone else to wait in line for you.

A fundamental principle of economics is that every choice has an
opportunity cost. If you sleep through your economics class, the
opportunity cost is the learning you miss from not attending class. If
you spend your income on video games, you cannot spend it on movies. If
you choose to marry one person, you give up the opportunity to marry
anyone else. In short, opportunity cost is all around us and part of
human existence.

The following Work It Out feature shows a step-by-step analysis of a
budget constraint calculation. Read through it to understand another
important concept---slope---that we further explain in the @sec-appendix-a.

#### Work It Out {#work-it-out .Heading3Grey}

##### Understanding Budget Constraints {#understanding-budget-constraints .Heading4Grey}

Budget constraints are easy to understand if you apply a little math.
The @sec-appendix-a
explains all the math you are likely to need in this book. Therefore, if
math is not your strength, you might want to take a look at the
appendix.

Step 1: The equation for any budget constraint is:

$\text{Budget} = \text{P}_{1}\text{~×~Q}_{1}\text{~+~P}_{2\ }\text{×~Q}_{2}$

where P and Q are the price and quantity of items purchased (which we
assume here to be two items) and Budget is the amount of income one has
to spend.

Step 2. Apply the budget constraint equation to the scenario. In
Alphonso's case, this works out to be:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { Budget } & =\mathrm{P}_1 \times \mathrm{Q}_1+\mathrm{P}_2 \times \mathrm{Q}_2 \\
\$ 10 \text { budget } & =\$ 2 \text { per burger } \times \text { quantity of burgers }+\$ 0.50 \text { per bus ticket } \times \text { quantity of bus tickets } \\
\$ 10 & =\$ 2 \times \mathrm{Q}_{\text {burgers }}+\$ 0.50 \times \mathrm{Q}_{\text {bus tickets }}
\end{aligned}
$$

Step 3. Using a little algebra, we can turn this into the familiar
equation of a line:

$$
y=b+m x
$$

For Alphonso, this is:

$$
\$ 10=\$ 2 \times Q_{\text {burgers }}+\$ 0.50 \times Q_{\text {bus tickets }}
$$

Step 4. Simplify the equation. Begin by multiplying both sides of the
equation by 2:

$$
\begin{aligned}
2 \times 10 & =2 \times 2 \times Q_{\text {burgers }}+2 \times 0.5 \times Q_{\text {bus tickets }} \\
20 & =4 \times Q_{\text {burgers }}+1 \times Q_{\text {bus tickets }}
\end{aligned}
$$

Step 5. Subtract one bus ticket from both sides:

$$
20-Q_{\text {bus tickets }}=4 \times Q_{\text {burgers }}
$$

Divide each side by 4 to yield the answer:

$$
\begin{aligned}
5-0.25 \times \mathrm{Q}_{\text {bus tickets }} & =\mathrm{Q}_{\text {burgers }} \\
& \text { or } \\
\mathrm{Q}_{\text {burgers }} & =5-0.25 \times \mathrm{Q}_{\text {bus tickets }}
\end{aligned}
$$

Step 6. Notice that this equation fits the budget constraint in [Figure
2.2](#fig-2_2). The vertical intercept is 5 and the slope is
--0.25, just as the equation says. If you plug 20 bus tickets into the
equation, you get 0 burgers. If you plug other numbers of bus tickets
into the equation, you get the results (see @tbl-table_2_1),
which are the points on Alphonso's budget constraint.


| Point | Quantity of Burgers (at $2) | Quantity of Bus Tickets (at 50 cents) |
|-------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| A     | 5                           | 0                                     |
| B     | 4                           | 4                                     |
| C     | 3                           | 8                                     |
| D     | 2                           | 12                                    |
| E     | 1                           | 16                                    |
| F     | 0                           | 20                                    |

: Step 6 {#tbl-table_2_1}

Step 7. Notice that the slope of a budget constraint always shows the
opportunity cost of the good which is on the horizontal axis. For
Alphonso, the slope is −0.25, indicating that for every bus ticket he
buys, he must give up 1/4 burger. To phrase it differently, for every
four tickets he buys, Alphonso must give up 1 burger.

There are two important observations here. First, the algebraic sign of
the slope is negative, which means that the only way to get more of one
good is to give up some of the other. Second, we define the slope as the
price of bus tickets (whatever is on the horizontal axis in the graph)
divided by the price of burgers (whatever is on the vertical axis), in
this case \$0.50/\$2 = 0.25. If you want to determine the opportunity
cost quickly, just divide the two prices.

#### Identifying Opportunity Cost

In many cases, it is reasonable to refer to the opportunity cost as the
price. If your cousin buys a new bicycle for \$300, then \$300 measures
the amount of "other consumption" that he has forsaken. For practical
purposes, there may be no special need to identify the specific
alternative product or products that he could have bought with that
\$300, but sometimes the price as measured in dollars may not accurately
capture the true opportunity cost. This problem can loom especially
large when costs of time are involved.

For example, consider a boss who decides that all employees will attend
a two-day retreat to "build team spirit." The out-of-pocket monetary
cost of the event may involve hiring an outside consulting firm to run
the retreat, as well as room and board for all participants. However, an
opportunity cost exists as well: during the two days of the retreat,
none of the employees are doing any other work.

Attending college is another case where the opportunity cost exceeds the
monetary cost. The out-of-pocket costs of attending college include
tuition, books, room and board, and other expenses. However, in
addition, during the hours that you are attending class and studying, it
is impossible to work at a paying job. Thus, college imposes both an
out-of-pocket cost and an opportunity cost of lost earnings.

#### Clear It Up {#clear-it-up .Heading3Grey}

##### What is the opportunity cost associated with increased airport security measures? {#what-is-the-opportunity-cost-associated-with-increased-airport-security-measures .Heading4Grey}

After the terrorist plane hijackings on September 11, 2001, many steps
were proposed to improve air travel safety. For example, the federal
government could provide armed "sky marshals" who would travel
inconspicuously with the rest of the passengers. The cost of having a
sky marshal on every flight would be roughly \$3 billion per year.
Retrofitting all U.S. planes with reinforced cockpit doors to make it
harder for terrorists to take over the plane would have a price tag of
\$450 million. Buying more sophisticated security equipment for
airports, like three-dimensional baggage scanners and cameras linked to
face recognition software, could cost another \$2 billion.

However, the single biggest cost of greater airline security does not
involve spending money. It is the opportunity cost of additional waiting
time at the airport. According to the United States Department of
Transportation (DOT), there were 895.5 million systemwide (domestic and
international) scheduled service passengers in 2015. Since the 9/11
hijackings, security screening has become more intensive, and
consequently, the procedure takes longer than in the past. Say that, on
average, each air passenger spends an extra 30 minutes in the airport
per trip. Economists commonly place a value on time to convert an
opportunity cost in time into a monetary figure. Because many air
travelers are relatively high-paid business people, conservative
estimates set the average price of time for air travelers at \$20 per
hour. By these back-of-the-envelope calculations, the opportunity cost
of delays in airports could be as much as 800 million × 0.5 hours ×
\$20/hour, or \$8 billion per year. Clearly, the opportunity costs of
waiting time can be just as important as costs that involve direct
spending.

In some cases, realizing the opportunity cost can alter behavior.
Imagine, for example, that you spend \$8 on lunch every day at work. You
may know perfectly well that bringing a lunch from home would cost only
\$3 a day, so the opportunity cost of buying lunch at the restaurant is
\$5 each day (that is, the \$8 buying lunch costs minus the \$3 your
lunch from home would cost). Five dollars each day does not seem to be
that much. However, if you project what that adds up to in a year---250
days a year × \$5 per day equals \$1,250, the cost, perhaps, of a decent
vacation. If you describe the opportunity cost as "a nice vacation"
instead of "\$5 a day," you might make different choices.

#### Marginal Decision-Making and Diminishing Marginal Utility

The budget constraint framework helps to emphasize that most choices in
the real world are not about getting all of one thing or all of another;
that is, they are not about choosing either the point at one end of the
budget constraint or else the point all the way at the other end.
Instead, most choices involve marginal analysis, which means examining
the benefits and costs of choosing a little more or a little less of a
good. People naturally compare costs and benefits, but often we look at
total costs and total benefits, when the optimal choice necessitates
comparing how costs and benefits change from one option to another. You
might think of marginal analysis as "change analysis." Marginal analysis
is used throughout economics.

We now turn to the notion of utility. People desire goods and services
for the satisfaction or utility those goods and services provide.
Utility, as we will see in the chapter on @sec-chapter-6,
is subjective but that does not make it less real. Economists typically
assume that the more of some good one consumes (for example, slices of
pizza), the more utility one obtains. At the same time, the utility a
person receives from consuming the first unit of a good is typically
more than the utility received from consuming the fifth or the tenth
unit of that same good. When Alphonso chooses between burgers and bus
tickets, for example, the first few bus rides that he chooses might
provide him with a great deal of utility---perhaps they help him get to
a job interview or a doctor's appointment. However, later bus rides
might provide much less utility---they may only serve to kill time on a
rainy day. Similarly, the first burger that Alphonso chooses to buy may
be on a day when he missed breakfast and is ravenously hungry. However,
if Alphonso has multiple burgers every day, the last few burgers may
taste pretty boring. The general pattern that consumption of the first
few units of any good tends to bring a higher level of utility to a
person than consumption of later units is a common pattern. Economists
refer to this pattern as the law of diminishing marginal utility, which
means that as a person receives more of a good, the additional (or
marginal) utility from each additional unit of the good declines. In
other words, the first slice of pizza brings more satisfaction than the
sixth.

The law of diminishing marginal utility explains why people and
societies rarely make all-or-nothing choices. You would not say, "My
favorite food is ice cream, so I will eat nothing but ice cream from now
on." Instead, even if you get a very high level of utility from your
favorite food, if you ate it exclusively, the additional or marginal
utility from those last few servings would not be very high. Similarly,
most workers do not say: "I enjoy leisure, so I'll never work." Instead,
workers recognize that even though some leisure is very nice, a
combination of all leisure and no income is not so attractive. The
budget constraint framework suggests that when people make choices in a
world of scarcity, they will use marginal analysis and think about
whether they would prefer a little more or a little less.

A rational consumer would only purchase additional units of some product
as long as the marginal utility exceeds the opportunity cost. Suppose
Alphonso moves down his budget constraint from Point A to Point B to
Point C and further. As he consumes more bus tickets, the marginal
utility of bus tickets will diminish, while the opportunity cost, that
is, the marginal utility of foregone burgers, will increase. Eventually,
the opportunity cost will exceed the marginal utility of an additional
bus ticket. If Alphonso is rational, he won't purchase more bus tickets
once the marginal utility just equals the opportunity cost. While we
can't (yet) say exactly how many bus tickets Alphonso will buy, that
number is unlikely to be the most he can afford, 20.

#### Sunk Costs

In the budget constraint framework, all decisions involve what will
happen next: that is, what quantities of goods will you consume, how
many hours will you work, or how much will you save. These decisions do
not look back to past choices. Thus, the budget constraint framework
assumes that sunk costs, which are costs that were incurred in the past
and cannot be recovered, should not affect the current decision.

Consider the case of Selena, who pays \$8 to see a movie, but after
watching the film for 30 minutes, she knows that it is truly terrible.
Should she stay and watch the rest of the movie because she paid for the
ticket, or should she leave? The money she spent is a sunk cost, and
unless the theater manager is sympathetic, Selena will not get a refund.
However, staying in the movie still means paying an opportunity cost in
time. Her choice is whether to spend the next 90 minutes suffering
through a cinematic disaster or to do something---anything---else. The
lesson of sunk costs is to forget about the money and time that is
irretrievably gone and instead to focus on the marginal costs and
benefits of current and future options.

For people and firms alike, dealing with sunk costs can be frustrating.
It often means admitting an earlier error in judgment. Many firms, for
example, find it hard to give up on a new product that is doing poorly
because they spent so much money in creating and launching the product.
However, the lesson of sunk costs is to ignore them and make decisions
based on what will happen in the future.

#### From a Model with Two Goods to One of Many Goods

The budget constraint diagram containing just two goods, like most
models used in this book, is not realistic. After all, in a modern
economy people choose from thousands of goods. However, thinking about a
model with many goods is a straightforward extension of what we
discussed here. Instead of drawing just one budget constraint, showing
the tradeoff between two goods, you can draw multiple budget
constraints, showing the possible tradeoffs between many different pairs
of goods. In more advanced classes in economics, you would use
mathematical equations that include many possible goods and services
that can be purchased, together with their quantities and prices, and
show how the total spending on all goods and services is limited to the
overall budget available. The graph with two goods that we presented
here clearly illustrates that every choice has an opportunity cost,
which is the point that does carry over to the real world.


### 2.2 The Production Possibilities Frontier and Social Choices

#### Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

-   Interpret production possibilities frontier graphs
-   Contrast a budget constraint and a production possibilities frontier
-   Explain the relationship between a production possibilities frontier
    and the law of diminishing returns
-   Contrast productive efficiency and allocative efficiency
-   Define comparative advantage

Just as individuals cannot have everything they want and must instead
make choices, society as a whole cannot have everything it might want,
either. This section of the chapter will explain the constraints society
faces, using a model called the production possibilities frontier (PPF).
There are more similarities than differences between individual choice
and social choice. As you read this section, focus on the similarities.

Because society has limited resources (e.g., labor, land, capital, raw
materials) at any point in time, there is a limit to the quantities of
goods and services it can produce. Suppose a society desires two
products, healthcare and education. The production possibilities
frontier in [Figure 2.3](#fig-2_3) illustrates this situation.

![](media/2-2-the-production-possibilities-frontier-and-social-choices_rId23.jpeg){width="3.25in" height="2.345in" #fig-2_3}

Figure 2.3 A Healthcare vs. Education Production Possibilities Frontier
This production possibilities frontier shows a tradeoff between devoting
social resources to healthcare and devoting them to education. At A all
resources go to healthcare and at B, most go to healthcare. At D most
resources go to education, and at F, all go to education.

[Figure 2.3](#fig-2_3) shows healthcare on the vertical axis
and education on the horizontal axis. If the society were to allocate
all of its resources to healthcare, it could produce at point A.
However, it would not have any resources to produce education. If it
were to allocate all of its resources to education, it could produce at
point F. Alternatively, the society could choose to produce any
combination of healthcare and education on the production possibilities
frontier. In effect, the production possibilities frontier plays the
same role for society as the budget constraint plays for Alphonso.
Society can choose any combination of the two goods on or inside the
PPF. However, it does not have enough resources to produce outside the
PPF.

Most importantly, the production possibilities frontier clearly shows
the tradeoff between healthcare and education. Suppose society has
chosen to operate at point B, and it is considering producing more
education. Because the PPF is downward sloping from left to right, the
only way society can obtain more education is by giving up some
healthcare. That is the tradeoff society faces. Suppose it considers
moving from point B to point C. What would the opportunity cost be for
the additional education? The opportunity cost would be the healthcare
society has to forgo. Just as with Alphonso's budget constraint, the
slope of the production possibilities frontier shows the opportunity
cost. By now you might be saying, "Hey, this PPF is sounding like the
budget constraint." If so, read the following Clear It Up feature.

#### Clear It Up {#clear-it-up .Heading3Grey}

##### What's the difference between a budget constraint and a PPF? {#whats-the-difference-between-a-budget-constraint-and-a-ppf .Heading4Grey}

There are two major differences between a budget constraint and a
production possibilities frontier. The first is the fact that the budget
constraint is a straight line. This is because its slope is given by the
relative prices of the two goods, which from the point of view of an
individual consumer, are fixed, so the slope doesn\'t change. In
contrast, the PPF has a curved shape because of the law of the
diminishing returns. Thus, the slope is different at various points on
the PPF. The second major difference is the absence of specific numbers
on the axes of the PPF. There are no specific numbers because we do not
know the exact amount of resources this imaginary economy has, nor do we
know how many resources it takes to produce healthcare and how many
resources it takes to produce education. If this were a real world
example, that data would be available.

Whether or not we have specific numbers, conceptually we can measure the
opportunity cost of additional education as society moves from point B
to point C on the PPF. We measure the additional education by the
horizontal distance between B and C. The foregone healthcare is given by
the vertical distance between B and C. The slope of the PPF between B
and C is (approximately) the vertical distance (the "rise") over the
horizontal distance (the "run"). This is the opportunity cost of the
additional education.

#### The PPF and the Law of Increasing Opportunity Cost

The budget constraints that we presented earlier in this chapter,
showing individual choices about what quantities of goods to consume,
were all straight lines. The reason for these straight lines was that
the relative prices of the two goods in the consumption budget
constraint determined the slope of the budget constraint. However, we
drew the production possibilities frontier for healthcare and education
as a curved line. Why does the PPF have a different shape?

To understand why the PPF is curved, start by considering point A at the
top left-hand side of the PPF. At point A, all available resources are
devoted to healthcare and none are left for education. This situation
would be extreme and even ridiculous. For example, children are seeing a
doctor every day, whether they are sick or not, but not attending
school. People are having cosmetic surgery on every part of their
bodies, but no high school or college education exists. Now imagine that
some of these resources are diverted from healthcare to education, so
that the economy is at point B instead of point A. Diverting some
resources away from A to B causes relatively little reduction in health
because the last few marginal dollars going into healthcare services are
not producing much additional gain in health. However, putting those
marginal dollars into education, which is completely without resources
at point A, can produce relatively large gains. For this reason, the
shape of the PPF from A to B is relatively flat, representing a
relatively small drop-off in health and a relatively large gain in
education.

Now consider the other end, at the lower right, of the production
possibilities frontier. Imagine that society starts at choice D, which
is devoting nearly all resources to education and very few to
healthcare, and moves to point F, which is devoting *all* spending to
education and none to healthcare. For the sake of concreteness, you can
imagine that in the movement from D to F, the last few doctors must
become high school science teachers, the last few nurses must become
school librarians rather than dispensers of vaccinations, and the last
few emergency rooms are turned into kindergartens. The gains to
education from adding these last few resources to education are very
small. However, the opportunity cost lost to health will be fairly
large, and thus the slope of the PPF between D and F is steep, showing a
large drop in health for only a small gain in education.

The lesson is not that society is likely to make an extreme choice like
devoting no resources to education at point A or no resources to health
at point F. Instead, the lesson is that the gains from committing
additional marginal resources to education depend on how much is already
being spent. If on the one hand, very few resources are currently
committed to education, then an increase in resources used for education
can bring relatively large gains. On the other hand, if a large number
of resources are already committed to education, then committing
additional resources will bring relatively smaller gains.

This pattern is common enough that economists have given it a name: the
law of increasing opportunity cost, which holds that as production of a
good or service increases, the marginal opportunity cost of producing it
increases as well. This happens because some resources are better suited
for producing certain goods and services instead of others. When
government spends a certain amount more on reducing crime, for example,
the original increase in opportunity cost of reducing crime could be
relatively small. However, additional increases typically cause
relatively larger increases in the opportunity cost of reducing crime,
and paying for enough police and security to reduce crime to nothing at
all would be a tremendously high opportunity cost.

The curvature of the production possibilities frontier shows that as we
add more resources to education, moving from left to right along the
horizontal axis, the original increase in opportunity cost is fairly
small, but gradually increases. Thus, the slope of the PPF is relatively
flat near the vertical-axis intercept. Conversely, as we add more
resources to healthcare, moving from bottom to top on the vertical axis,
the original declines in opportunity cost are fairly large, but again
gradually diminish. Thus, the slope of the PPF is relatively steep near
the horizontal-axis intercept. In this way, the law of increasing
opportunity cost produces the outward-bending shape of the production
possibilities frontier.

#### Productive Efficiency and Allocative Efficiency

The study of economics does not presume to tell a society what choice it
should make along its production possibilities frontier. In a
market-oriented economy with a democratic government, the choice will
involve a mixture of decisions by individuals, firms, and government.
However, economics can point out that some choices are unambiguously
better than others. This observation is based on the concept of
efficiency. In everyday usage, efficiency refers to lack of waste. An
inefficient machine operates at high cost, while an efficient machine
operates at lower cost, because it is not wasting energy or materials.
An inefficient organization operates with long delays and high costs,
while an efficient organization meets schedules, is focused, and
performs within budget.

The production possibilities frontier can illustrate two kinds of
efficiency: productive efficiency and allocative efficiency. [Figure
2.4](#fig-2_4) illustrates these ideas using a production
possibilities frontier between healthcare and education.

![](media/2-2-the-production-possibilities-frontier-and-social-choices_rId33.jpeg){width="3.25in" height="2.615in" #fig-2_4}

Figure 2.4 Productive and Allocative Efficiency Productive efficiency
means it is impossible to produce more of one good without decreasing
the quantity that is produced of another good. Thus, all choices along a
given PPF like B, C, and D display productive efficiency, but R does
not. Allocative efficiency means that the particular mix of goods being
produced---that is, the specific choice along the production
possibilities frontier---represents the allocation that society most
desires.

Productive efficiency means that, given the available inputs and
technology, it is impossible to produce more of one good without
decreasing the quantity that is produced of another good. All choices on
the PPF in [Figure 2.4](#fig-2_4), including A, B, C, D, and F,
display productive efficiency. As a firm moves from any one of these
choices to any other, either healthcare increases and education
decreases or vice versa. However, any choice inside the production
possibilities frontier is productively inefficient and wasteful because
it is possible to produce more of one good, the other good, or some
combination of both goods.

For example, point R is productively inefficient because it is possible
at choice C to have more of both goods: education on the horizontal axis
is higher at point C than point R (E~2~ is greater than E~1~), and
healthcare on the vertical axis is also higher at point C than point R
(H~2~ is great than H~1~).

We can show the particular mix of goods and services produced---that is,
the specific combination of selected healthcare and education along the
production possibilities frontier---as a ray (line) from the origin to a
specific point on the PPF. Output mixes that had more healthcare (and
less education) would have a steeper ray, while those with more
education (and less healthcare) would have a flatter ray.

Allocative efficiency means that the particular combination of goods and
services on the production possibility curve that a society produces
represents the combination that society most desires. How to determine
what a society desires can be a controversial question, and is usually a
discussion in political science, sociology, and philosophy classes as
well as in economics. At its most basic, allocative efficiency means
producers supply the quantity of each product that consumers demand.
Only one of the productively efficient choices will be the allocatively
efficient choice for society as a whole.

#### Why Society Must Choose

In @sec-chapter-1
we learned that every society faces the problem of scarcity, where
limited resources conflict with unlimited needs and wants. The
production possibilities curve illustrates the choices involved in this
dilemma.

Every economy faces two situations in which it may be able to expand
consumption of all goods. In the first case, a society may discover that
it has been using its resources inefficiently, in which case by
improving efficiency and producing on the production possibilities
frontier, it can have more of all goods (or at least more of some and
less of none). In the second case, as resources grow over a period of
years (e.g., more labor and more capital), the economy grows. As it
does, the production possibilities frontier for a society will tend to
shift outward and society will be able to afford more of all goods. In
addition, over time, improvements in technology can increase the level
of production with given resources, and hence push out the PPF.

However, improvements in productive efficiency take time to discover and
implement, and economic growth happens only gradually. Thus, a society
must choose between tradeoffs in the present. For government, this
process often involves trying to identify where additional spending
could do the most good and where reductions in spending would do the
least harm. At the individual and firm level, the market economy
coordinates a process in which firms seek to produce goods and services
in the quantity, quality, and price that people want. However, for both
the government and the market economy in the short term, increases in
production of one good typically mean offsetting decreases somewhere
else in the economy.

#### The PPF and Comparative Advantage

While every society must choose how much of each good or service it
should produce, it does not need to produce every single good it
consumes. Often how much of a good a country decides to produce depends
on how expensive it is to produce it versus buying it from a different
country. As we saw earlier, the curvature of a country's PPF gives us
information about the tradeoff between devoting resources to producing
one good versus another. In particular, its slope gives the opportunity
cost of producing one more unit of the good in the x-axis in terms of
the other good (in the y-axis). Countries tend to have different
opportunity costs of producing a specific good, either because of
different climates, geography, technology, or skills.

Suppose two countries, the US and Brazil, need to decide how much they
will produce of two crops: sugar cane and wheat. Due to its climatic
conditions, Brazil can produce quite a bit of sugar cane per acre but
not much wheat. Conversely, the U.S. can produce large amounts of wheat
per acre, but not much sugar cane. Clearly, Brazil has a lower
opportunity cost of producing sugar cane (in terms of wheat) than the
U.S. The reverse is also true: the U.S. has a lower opportunity cost of
producing wheat than Brazil. We illustrate this by the PPFs of the two
countries in [Figure 2.5](#fig-2_5).

![](media/2-2-the-production-possibilities-frontier-and-social-choices_rId45.jpeg){width="6.5in" height="3.345in" #fig-2_5}

Figure 2.5 Production Possibility Frontier for the U.S. and Brazil The
U.S. PPF is flatter than the Brazil PPF implying that the opportunity
cost of wheat in terms of sugar cane is lower in the U.S. than in
Brazil. Conversely, the opportunity cost of sugar cane is lower in
Brazil. The U.S. has comparative advantage in wheat and Brazil has
comparative advantage in sugar cane.

When a country can produce a good at a lower opportunity cost than
another country, we say that this country has a comparative advantage in
that good. Comparative advantage is not the same as absolute advantage,
which is when a country can produce more of a good. In our example,
Brazil has an absolute advantage in sugar cane and the U.S. has an
absolute advantage in wheat. One can easily see this with a simple
observation of the extreme production points in the PPFs of the two
countries. If Brazil devoted all of its resources to producing wheat, it
would be producing at point A. If however it had devoted all of its
resources to producing sugar cane instead, it would be producing a much
larger amount than the U.S., at point B.

The slope of the PPF gives the opportunity cost of producing an
additional unit of wheat. While the slope is not constant throughout the
PPFs, it is quite apparent that the PPF in Brazil is much steeper than
in the U.S., and therefore the opportunity cost of wheat is generally
higher in Brazil. In @sec-chapter-19
you will learn that countries' differences in comparative advantage
determine which goods they will choose to produce and trade. When
countries engage in trade, they specialize in the production of the
goods in which they have comparative advantage, and trade part of that
production for goods in which they do not have comparative advantage.
With trade, manufacturers produce goods where the opportunity cost is
lowest, so total production increases, benefiting both trading parties.


### 2.3 Confronting Objections to the Economic Approach

#### Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

-   Analyze arguments against economic approaches to decision-making
-   Interpret a tradeoff diagram
-   Contrast normative statements and positive statements

It is one thing to understand the economic approach to decision-making
and another thing to feel comfortable applying it. The sources of
discomfort typically fall into two categories: that people do not act in
the way that fits the economic way of thinking, and that even if people
did act that way, they should try not to. Let's consider these arguments
in turn.

#### First Objection: People, Firms, and Society Do Not Act Like This

The economic approach to decision-making seems to require more
information than most individuals possess and more careful
decision-making than most individuals actually display. After all, do
you or any of your friends draw a budget constraint and mutter to
yourself about maximizing utility before you head to the shopping mall?
Do members of the U.S. Congress contemplate production possibilities
frontiers before they vote on the annual budget? The messy ways in which
people and societies operate somehow doesn't look much like neat budget
constraints or smoothly curving production possibilities frontiers.

However, the economics approach can be a useful way to analyze and
understand the tradeoffs of economic decisions. To appreciate this
point, imagine for a moment that you are playing basketball, dribbling
to the right, and throwing a bounce-pass to the left to a teammate who
is running toward the basket. A physicist or engineer could work out the
correct speed and trajectory for the pass, given the different movements
involved and the weight and bounciness of the ball. However, when you
are playing basketball, you do not perform any of these calculations.
You just pass the ball, and if you are a good player, you will do so
with high accuracy.

Someone might argue: "The scientist's formula of the bounce-pass
requires a far greater knowledge of physics and far more specific
information about speeds of movement and weights than the basketball
player actually has, so it must be an unrealistic description of how
basketball passes actually occur." This reaction would be wrongheaded.
The fact that a good player can throw the ball accurately because of
practice and skill, without making a physics calculation, does not mean
that the physics calculation is wrong.

Similarly, from an economic point of view, someone who shops for
groceries every week has a great deal of practice with how to purchase
the combination of goods that will provide that person with utility,
even if the shopper does not phrase decisions in terms of a budget
constraint. Government institutions may work imperfectly and slowly, but
in general, a democratic form of government feels pressure from voters
and social institutions to make the choices that are most widely
preferred by people in that society. Thus, when thinking about the
economic actions of groups of people, firms, and society, it is
reasonable, as a first approximation, to analyze them with the tools of
economic analysis. For more on this, read about behavioral economics in
the chapter on @sec-chapter-6.

#### Second Objection: People, Firms, and Society Should Not Act This Way

The economics approach portrays people as self-interested. For some
critics of this approach, even if self-interest is an accurate
description of how people behave, these behaviors are not moral.
Instead, the critics argue that people should be taught to care more
deeply about others. Economists offer several answers to these concerns.

First, economics is not a form of moral instruction. Rather, it seeks to
describe economic behavior as it actually exists. Philosophers draw a
distinction between positive statements, which describe the world as it
is, and normative statements, which describe how the world should be.
Positive statements are factual. They may be true or false, but we can
test them, at least in principle. Normative statements are subjective
questions of opinion. We cannot test them since we cannot prove opinions
to be true or false. They just are opinions based on one\'s values. For
example, an economist could analyze a proposed subway system in a
certain city. If the expected benefits exceed the costs, he concludes
that the project is worthy---an example of positive analysis. Another
economist argues for extended unemployment compensation during the
COVID-19 pandemic because a rich country like the United States should
take care of its less fortunate citizens---an example of normative
analysis.

Even if the line between positive and normative statements is not always
crystal clear, economic analysis does try to remain rooted in the study
of the actual people who inhabit the actual economy. Fortunately
however, the assumption that individuals are purely self-interested is a
simplification about human nature. In fact, we need to look no further
than to Adam Smith, the very father of modern economics to find evidence
of this. The opening sentence of his book, *The Theory of Moral
Sentiments*, puts it very clearly: "How selfish soever man may be
supposed, there are evidently some principles in his nature, which
interest him in the fortune of others, and render their happiness
necessary to him, though he derives nothing from it except the pleasure
of seeing it." Clearly, individuals are both self-interested and
altruistic.

Second, we can label self-interested behavior and profit-seeking with
other names, such as personal choice and freedom. The ability to make
personal choices about buying, working, and saving is an important
personal freedom. Some people may choose high-pressure, high-paying jobs
so that they can earn and spend considerable amounts of money on
themselves. Others may allocate large portions of their earnings to
charity or spend it on their friends and family. Others may devote
themselves to a career that can require much time, energy, and expertise
but does not offer high financial rewards, like being an elementary
school teacher or a social worker. Still others may choose a job that
does consume much of their time or provide a high level of income, but
still leaves time for family, friends, and contemplation. Some people
may prefer to work for a large company; others might want to start their
own business. People's freedom to make their own economic choices has a
moral value worth respecting.

#### Clear It Up {#clear-it-up .Heading3Grey}

##### Is a diagram by any other name the same? {#is-a-diagram-by-any-other-name-the-same .Heading4Grey}

When you study economics, you may feel buried under an avalanche of
diagrams. Your goal should be to recognize the common underlying logic
and pattern of the diagrams, not to memorize each one.

This chapter uses only one basic diagram, although we present it with
different sets of labels. The consumption budget constraint and the
production possibilities frontier for society, as a whole, are the same
basic diagram. [Figure 2.6](#fig-2_6) shows an individual
budget constraint and a production possibilities frontier for two goods,
Good 1 and Good 2. The tradeoff diagram always illustrates three basic
themes: scarcity, tradeoffs, and economic efficiency.

The first theme is scarcity. It is not feasible to have unlimited
amounts of both goods. Even if the budget constraint or a PPF shifts,
scarcity remains---just at a different level. The second theme is
tradeoffs. As depicted in the budget constraint or the production
possibilities frontier, it is necessary to forgo some of one good to
gain more of the other good. The details of this tradeoff vary. In a
budget constraint we determine, the tradeoff is determined by the
relative prices of the goods: that is, the relative price of two goods
in the consumption choice budget constraint. These tradeoffs appear as a
straight line. However, a curved line represents the tradeoffs in many
production possibilities frontiers because the law of diminishing
returns holds that as we add resources to an area, the marginal gains
tend to diminish. Regardless of the specific shape, tradeoffs remain.

The third theme is economic efficiency, or getting the most benefit from
scarce resources. All choices on the production possibilities frontier
show productive efficiency because in such cases, there is no way to
increase the quantity of one good without decreasing the quantity of the
other. Similarly, when an individual makes a choice along a budget
constraint, there is no way to increase the quantity of one good without
decreasing the quantity of the other. The choice on a production
possibilities set that is socially preferred, or the choice on an
individual's budget constraint that is personally preferred, will
display allocative efficiency.

The basic budget constraint/production possibilities frontier diagram
will recur throughout this book. Some examples include using these
tradeoff diagrams to analyze trade, environmental protection and
economic output, equality of incomes and economic output, and the
macroeconomic tradeoff between consumption and investment. Do not allow
the different labels to confuse you. The budget constraint/production
possibilities frontier diagram is always just a tool for thinking
carefully about scarcity, tradeoffs, and efficiency in a particular
situation.

![](media/2-3-confronting-objections-to-the-economic-approach_rId31.jpeg){width="6.5in" height="2.62in" #fig-2_6}

Figure 2.6 The Tradeoff Diagram Both the individual opportunity set (or
budget constraint) and the social production possibilities frontier show
the constraints under which individual consumers and society as a whole
operate. Both diagrams show the tradeoff in choosing more of one good at
the cost of less of the other.

Third, self-interested behavior can lead to positive social results. For
example, when people work hard to make a living, they create economic
output. Consumers who are looking for the best deals will encourage
businesses to offer goods and services that meet their needs. Adam
Smith, writing in *The Wealth of Nations*, named this property the
invisible hand. In describing how consumers and producers interact in a
market economy, Smith wrote:

> Every individual...generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the
> public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring

> his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as

> pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society
> more effectually than when he really intends to promote it.

The metaphor of the invisible hand suggests the remarkable possibility
that broader social good can emerge from selfish individual actions.

Fourth, even people who focus on their own self-interest in the economic
part of their life often set aside their own narrow self-interest in
other parts of life. For example, you might focus on your own
self-interest when asking your employer for a raise or negotiating to
buy a car. Then you might turn around and focus on other people when you
volunteer to read stories at the local library, help a friend move to a
new apartment, or donate money to a charity. Self-interest is a
reasonable starting point for analyzing many economic decisions, without
needing to imply that people never do anything that is not in their own
immediate self-interest.

#### Bring It Home {#bring-it-home .Heading3Grey}

##### Choices \... to What Degree? {#choices-...-to-what-degree .Heading4Grey}

What have we learned? We know that scarcity impacts all the choices we
make. An economist might argue that people do not obtain a bachelor's or
master's degree because they do not have the resources to make those
choices or because their incomes are too low and/or the price of these
degrees is too high. A bachelor's or a master's degree may not be
available in their opportunity set.

The price of these degrees may be too high not only because the actual
price, college tuition (and perhaps room and board), is too high. An
economist might also say that for many people, the full opportunity cost
of a bachelor's or a master's degree is too high. For these people, they
are unwilling or unable to make the tradeoff of forfeiting years of
working, and earning an income, to earn a degree.

Finally, the statistics we introduced at the start of the chapter reveal
information about intertemporal choices. An economist might say that
people choose not to obtain a college degree because they may have to
borrow money to attend college, and the interest they have to pay on
that loan in the future will affect their decisions today. Also, it
could be that some people have a preference for current consumption over
future consumption, so they choose to work now at a lower salary and
consume now, rather than postponing that consumption until after they
graduate college.
