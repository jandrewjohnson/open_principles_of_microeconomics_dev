### Introduction to Labor Markets and Income

#### Bring It Home {#bring-it-home .Heading3Grey}

##### The Increasing Value of a College Degree  {#the-increasing-value-of-a-college-degree .Heading4Grey}

Working your way through college used to be fairly common in the United
States. According to a 2015 study by the Georgetown Center on Education
and the Workforce, 40% of college students work 30 hours or more per
week.

At the same time, the cost of college seems to rise every year. The data
show that between the 2000--2001 academic year and the 2019--2020
academic year, the cost of tuition, fees, and room and board has
slightly more than doubled for private four-year colleges, and has
increased by a factor of almost 2.5 for public four-year colleges. Thus,
even full time employment may not be enough to cover college expenses
anymore. Working full time at minimum wage---40 hours per week, 52 weeks
per year---earns \$15,080 before taxes, which is substantially less than
the more than \$25,000 estimated as the average cost in 2022 for a year
of college at a public university. The result of these costs is that
student loan debt topped \$1.3 trillion this year.

Despite these disheartening figures, the value of a bachelor's degree
has never been higher. How do we explain this? This chapter will tell
us.

In a market economy like the United States, income comes from ownership
of the means of production: resources or assets. More precisely, one's
income is a function of two things: the quantity of each resource one
owns, and the value society places on those resources. Recall from @sec-chapter-7,
each factor of production has an associated factor payment. For the
majority of us, the most important resource we own is our labor. Thus,
most of our income is wages, salaries, commissions, tips and other types
of labor income. Your labor income depends on how many hours you work
and the wage rate an employer will pay you for those hours. At the same
time, some people own real estate, which they can either use themselves
or rent out to other users. Some people have financial assets like bank
accounts, stocks and bonds, for which they earn interest, dividends or
some other form of income.

Each of these factor payments, like wages for labor and interest for
financial capital, is determined in their respective factor markets. For
the rest of this chapter, we will focus on labor markets, but other
factor markets operate similarly. Later in Chapter 17 we will describe
how this works for financial capital.


### 14.1 The Theory of Labor Markets

#### Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

-   Describe the demand for labor in perfectly competitive output
    markets
-   Describe the demand for labor in imperfectly competitive output
    markets
-   Identify what determines the going market rate for labor

#### Clear It Up {#clear-it-up .Heading3Grey}

##### What is the labor market? {#what-is-the-labor-market .Heading4Grey}

The labor market is the term that economists use for all the different
markets for labor. There is no single labor market. Rather, there is a
different market for every different type of labor. Labor differs by
type of work (e.g. retail sales vs. scientist), skill level (entry level
or more experienced), and location (the market for administrative
assistants is probably more local or regional than the market for
university presidents). While each labor market is different, they all
tend to operate in similar ways. For example, when wages go up in one
labor market, they tend to go up in others too. When economists talk
about the labor market, they are describing these similarities.

The labor market, like all markets, has a demand and a supply. Why do
firms demand labor? Why is an employer willing to pay you for your
labor? It's not because the employer likes you or is socially conscious.
Rather, it's because your labor is worth something to the
employer\--your work brings in revenues to the firm. How much is an
employer willing to pay? That depends on the skills and experience you
bring to the firm.

If a firm wants to maximize profits, it will never pay more (in terms of
wages and benefits) for a worker than the value of their marginal
productivity to the firm. We call this the first rule of labor markets.

Suppose a worker can produce two widgets per hour and the firm can sell
each widget for \$4 each. Then the worker is generating \$8 per hour in
revenues to the firm, and a profit-maximizing employer will pay the
worker up to, but no more than, \$8 per hour, because that is what the
worker is worth to the firm.

Recall the definition of marginal product. Marginal product is the
additional output a firm can produce by adding one more worker to the
production process. Since employers often hire labor by the hour, we'll
define marginal product as the additional output the firm produces by
adding one more worker hour to the production process. In this chapter,
we assume that workers in a particular labor market are
homogeneous---they have the same background, experience and skills and
they put in the same amount of effort. Thus, marginal product depends on
the capital and technology with which workers have to work.

A typist can type more pages per hour with an electric typewriter than a
manual typewriter, and the typist can type even more pages per hour with
a personal computer and word processing software. A ditch digger can dig
more cubic feet of dirt in an hour with a backhoe than with a shovel.

Thus, we can define the demand for labor as the marginal product of
labor times the value of that output to the firm.

| # Workers (L) | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
|---------------|---|---|---|---|
| MPL           | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 |

: Marginal Product of Labor {#tbl-table_14_1}

![](media/14-1-the-theory-of-labor-markets_rId24.jpeg){width="3.255in" height="2.405in" #fig-14_2}

Figure 14.2 Marginal Product of Labor Because of fixed capital, the
marginal product of labor declines as the employer hires additional
workers.

On what does the value of each worker's marginal product depend? If we
assume that the employer sells its output in a perfectly competitive
market, the value of each worker's output will be the market price of
the product. Thus,

Demand for Labor = MP~L~ x P = Value of the Marginal Product of Labor

We show this in @tbl-table_14_2, which is an expanded version of
@tbl-table_14_1

| # Workers (L) | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
|---------------|---|---|---|---|
| MPL           | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 |
| Price of Output | $4 | $4 | $4 | $4 |
| VMPL          | $16 | $12 | $8 | $4 |

: Value of the Marginal Product of Labor {#tbl-table_14_2}

Note that the value of each additional worker is less than the value of
the ones who came before.

![](media/14-1-the-theory-of-labor-markets_rId27.jpeg){width="3.25in" height="2.455in" #fig-14_3}

Figure 14.3 Value of the Marginal Product of Labor For firms operating
in a competitive output market, the value of additional output sold is
the price the firms receive for the output. Since MP~L~ declines with
additional labor employed, while that marginal product is worth the
market price, the value of the marginal product declines as employment
increases.

#### Demand for Labor in Perfectly Competitive Output Markets

The question for any firm is how much labor to hire.

We can define a Perfectly Competitive Labor Market as one where firms
can hire all the labor they want at the going market wage. Think about
secretaries in a large city. Employers who need secretaries can probably
hire as many as they need if they pay the going wage rate.

Graphically, this means that firms face a horizontal supply curve for
labor, as Figure 14.3 shows.

Given the market wage, profit maximizing firms hire workers up to the
point where: W~mkt~ = VMP~L~

![](media/14-1-the-theory-of-labor-markets_rId31.jpeg){width="3.255in" height="2.405in" #fig-14_4}

Figure 14.4 Equilibrium Employment for Firms in a Competitive Labor
Market In a perfectly competitive labor market, firms can hire all the
labor they want at the going market wage. Therefore, they hire workers
up to the point L~1~ where the going market wage equals the value of the
marginal product of labor.

#### Clear It Up {#clear-it-up-1 .Heading3Grey}

##### Derived Demand {#derived-demand .Heading4Grey}

Economists describe the demand for inputs like labor as a derived
demand. Since the demand for labor is MPL\*P, it is dependent on the
demand for the product the firm is producing. We show this by the P term
in the demand for labor. An increase in demand for the firm's product
drives up the product's price, which increases the firm's demand for
labor. Thus, we derive the demand for labor from the demand for the
firm's output.

#### Demand for Labor in Imperfectly Competitive Output Markets

If the employer does not sell its output in a perfectly competitive
industry, they face a downward sloping demand curve for output, which
means that in order to sell additional output the firm must lower its
price. This is true if the firm is a monopoly, but it's also true if the
firm is an oligopoly or monopolistically competitive. In this situation,
the value of a worker's marginal product is the marginal revenue, not
the price. Thus, the demand for labor is the marginal product times the
marginal revenue.

The Demand for Labor = MP~L~ x MR = Marginal Revenue Product

| # Workers (L) | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
|---------------|---|---|---|---|
| MPL           | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 |
| Marginal Revenue | $4 | $3 | $2 | $1 |
| MRPL          | $16 | $9 | $4 | $1 |

: Marginal Revenue Product {#tbl-table_14_3}

![](media/14-1-the-theory-of-labor-markets_rId38.jpeg){width="3.25in" height="2.455in" #fig-14_5}

Figure 14.5 Marginal Revenue Product For firms with some market power in
their output market, the value of additional output sold is the firm's
marginal revenue. Since MP~L~ declines with additional labor employed
and since MR declines with additional output sold, the firm's marginal
revenue declines as employment increases.

Everything else remains the same as we described above in the discussion
of the labor demand in perfectly competitive labor markets. Given the
market wage, profit-maximizing firms will hire workers up to the point
where the market wage equals the marginal revenue product, as [Figure
14.6](#fig-14_6) shows.

![](media/14-1-the-theory-of-labor-markets_rId41.jpeg){width="3.25in" height="2.405in" #fig-14_6}

Figure 14.6 Equilibrium Level of Employment for Firms with Market Power
For firms with market power in their output market, they choose the
number of workers, L~2~, where the going market wage equals the firm's
marginal revenue product. Note that since marginal revenue is less than
price, the demand for labor for a firm which has market power in its
output market is less than the demand for labor (L~1~) for a perfectly
competitive firm. As a result, employment will be lower in an
imperfectly competitive industry than in a perfectly competitive
industry.

#### Clear It Up {#clear-it-up-2 .Heading3Grey}

##### Do Profit Maximizing Employers Exploit Labor? {#do-profit-maximizing-employers-exploit-labor .Heading4Grey}

If you look back at [Figure 14.4](#fig-14_4), you will see that
the firm pays only the last worker it hires what they're worth to the
firm. Every other worker brings in more revenue than the firm pays them.
This has sometimes led to the claim that employers exploit workers
because they do not pay workers what they are worth. Let's think about
this claim. The first worker is worth \$x to the firm, and the second
worker is worth \$y, but why are they worth that much? It is because of
the capital and technology with which they work. The difference between
workers' worth and their compensation goes to pay for the capital and
technology, without which the workers wouldn't have a job. The
difference also goes to the employer's profit, without which the firm
would close and workers wouldn't have a job. The firm may be earning
excessive profits, but that is a different topic of discussion.

#### What Determines the Going Market Wage Rate?

In @sec-chapter-4,
we learned that the labor market has demand and supply curves like other
markets. The demand for labor curve is a downward sloping function of
the wage rate. The market demand for labor is the horizontal sum of all
firms' demands for labor. The supply of labor curve is an upward sloping
function of the wage rate. This is because if wages for a particular
type of labor increase in a particular labor market, people with
appropriate skills may change jobs, and vacancies will attract people
from outside the geographic area. The market supply of labor is the
horizontal summation of all individuals' supplies of labor.

![](media/14-1-the-theory-of-labor-markets_rId48.jpeg){width="3.25in" height="2.405in" #fig-14_7}

Figure 14.7 The Market Wage Rate In a competitive labor market, the
equilibrium wage and employment level are determined where the market
demand for labor equals the market supply of labor.

Like all equilibrium prices, the market wage rate is determined through
the interaction of supply and demand in the labor market. Thus, we can
see in [Figure 14.7](#fig-14_7) for competitive markets the wage
rate and number of workers hired.

The FRED database has a great deal of data on labor markets, starting at
[the wage rate and number of workers
hired](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/categories/10).

The United States Census Bureau for the Bureau of Labor Statistics
publishes *The Current Population Survey*, which is a monthly survey of
households (you can find a link to it by going to the FRED database
found in the previous link), which provides data on labor supply,
including numerous measures of the labor force size (disaggregated by
age, gender and educational attainment), labor force participation rates
for different demographic groups, and employment. It also includes more
than 3,500 measures of earnings by different demographic groups.

*The Current Employment Statistics*, which is a survey of businesses,
offers alternative estimates of employment across all sectors of the
economy.

The FRED database, found in the previous link, also has a link labeled
\"Productivity and Costs\" has a wide range of data on productivity,
labor costs, and profits across the business sector.


### 14.2 Wages and Employment in an Imperfectly Competitive Labor Market

#### Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

-   Define monopsony power
-   Explain how imperfectly competitive labor markets determine wages
    and employment, where employers have market power

In the chapters on market structure, we observed that while economists
use the theory of perfect competition as an ideal case of market
structure, there are very few examples of perfectly competitive
industries in the real world. What about labor markets? How many labor
markets are perfectly competitive? There are probably more examples of
perfectly competitive labor markets than perfectly competitive product
markets, but that doesn't mean that all labor markets are competitive.

When a job applicant is bargaining with an employer for a position, the
applicant is often at a disadvantage---needing the job more than the
employer needs that particular applicant. John Bates Clark (1847--1938),
often named as the first great American economist, wrote in 1907: "In
the making of the wages contract the individual laborer is always at a
disadvantage. He has something which he is obliged to sell and which his
employer is not obliged to take, since he \[that is, the employer\] can
reject single men with impunity."

To give workers more power, the U.S. government has passed, in response
to years of labor protests, a number of laws to create a more equal
balance of power between workers and employers. These laws include some
of the following:

-   Setting minimum hourly wages
-   Setting maximum hours of work (at least before employers pay
    overtime rates)
-   Prohibiting child labor
-   Regulating health and safety conditions in the workplace
-   Preventing discrimination on the basis of race, ethnicity, gender,
    sexual orientation, and age
-   Requiring employers to provide family leave
-   Requiring employers to give advance notice of layoffs
-   Covering workers with unemployment insurance
-   Setting a limit on the number of immigrant workers from other
    countries

@tbl-table_14_4 lists some prominent U.S. workplace protection
laws. Many of the laws listed in the table were only the start of labor
market regulations in these areas and have been followed, over time, by
other related laws, regulations, and court rulings.

: Prominent U.S. Workplace Protection Laws {#tbl-table_14_4}

There are two sources of imperfect competition in labor markets. These
are demand side sources, that is, labor market power by employers, and
supply side sources: labor market power by employees. In this section we
will discuss the former. In the next section we will discuss the latter.

A competitive labor market is one where there are many potential
employers for a given type of worker, say a secretary or an accountant.
Suppose there is only one employer in a labor market. Because that
employer has no direct competition in hiring, if they offer lower wages
than would exist in a competitive market, employees will have few
options. If they want a job, they must accept the offered wage rate.
Since the employer is exploiting its market power, we call the firm a
monopsony, a term introduced and widely discussed by Joan Robinson
(though she credited scholar Bertrand Hallward with invention of the
word). The classical example of monopsony is the sole coal company in a
West Virginia town. If coal miners want to work, they must accept what
the coal company is paying. This is not the only example of monopsony.
Think about surgical nurses in a town with only one hospital. A
situation in which employers have at least some market power over
potential employees is not that unusual. After all, most firms have many
employees while there is only one employer. Thus, even if there is some
competition for workers, it may not feel that way to potential employees
unless they do their research and find the opposite.

How does market power by an employer affect labor market outcomes?
Intuitively, one might think that wages will be lower than in a
competitive labor market. Let's prove it. We will tell the story for a
monopsonist, but the results will be qualitatively similar, although
less extreme, for any firm with labor market power.

Think back to monopoly. The good news for the firm is that because the
monopolist is the sole supplier in the market, it can charge any price
it wishes. The bad news is that if it wants to sell a greater quantity
of output, it must lower the price it charges. Monopsony is analogous.
Because the monopsonist is the sole employer in a labor market, it can
offer any wage that it wishes. However, because they face the market
supply curve for labor, if they want to hire more workers, they must
raise the wage they pay. This creates a quandary, which we can
understand by introducing a new concept: the marginal cost of labor. The
marginal cost of labor is the cost to the firm of hiring one more
worker. However, here is the thing: we assume that the firm is
determining how many workers to hire in total. They are not hiring
sequentially. Let's look how this plays out with the example in @tbl-table_14_5.

| Supply of Labor        | 1                | 2                | 3                | 4                | 5                |
|------------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Wage Rate              | $1 per hour      | $2 per hour      | $3 per hour      | $4 per hour      | $5 per hour      |
| Total Cost of Labor    | $1               | $4               | $9               | $16              | $25              |
| Marginal Cost of Labor | $1               | $3               | $5               | $7               | $9               |

: The Marginal Cost of Labor {#tbl-table_14_5}

There are a couple of things to notice from the table. First, the
marginal cost increases faster than the wage rate. In fact, for any
number of workers more than one, the marginal cost of labor is greater
than the wage. This is because to hire one more worker requires paying a
higher wage rate, not just for the new worker but for all the previous
hires also. We can see this graphically in Figure 14.7.

![](media/14-2-wages-and-employment-in-an-imperfectly-competitive-labor-market_rId24.jpeg){width="3.255in" height="2.405in" #fig-14_8}

Figure 14.8 The Marginal Cost of Labor Since monopsonies are the sole
demander for labor, they face the market supply curve for labor. In
order to increase employment they must raise the wage they pay not just
for new workers, but for all the existing workers they could have hired
at the previous lower wage. As a result, the marginal cost of hiring
additional labor is greater than the wage, and thus for any level of
employment (above the first worker), MC~L~ is above the Market Supply of
Labor.

![](media/14-2-wages-and-employment-in-an-imperfectly-competitive-labor-market_rId27.jpeg){width="3.255in" height="2.405in" #fig-14_9}

Figure 14.9 Labor Market Outcomes Under Monopsony A monopsony will hire
workers up to the point Lm where its demand for labor equals the
marginal cost of additional labor, paying the wage Wm given by the
supply curve of labor necessary to obtain Lm workers.

If the firm wants to maximize profits, it will hire labor up to the
point Lm where D~L~ = VMP (or MRP) = MC~L~, as [Figure
14.9](#fig-14_9) shows. Then, the supply curve for labor shows
the wage the firm will have to pay to attract Lm workers. Graphically,
we can draw a vertical line up from Lm to the Supply Curve for the label
and then read the wage Wm off the vertical axis to the left.

How does this outcome compare to what would occur in a perfectly
competitive market? A competitive market would operate where D~L~ =
S~L~, hiring Lc workers and paying Wc wage. In other words, under
monopsony employers hire fewer workers and pay a lower wage. While pure
monopsony may be rare, many employers have some degree of market power
in labor markets. The outcomes for those employers will be qualitatively
similar though not as extreme as monopsony.

![](media/14-2-wages-and-employment-in-an-imperfectly-competitive-labor-market_rId30.jpeg){width="3.25in" height="2.465in" #fig-14_10}

Figure 14.10 Comparison of labor market outcomes: Monopsony vs. Perfect
Competition A monopsony hires fewer workers (Lm) than would be hired in
a competitive labor market (Lc). In exploiting its market power, the
monopsony can also pay a lower wage (Wm) than workers would earn in a
competitive labor market (Wc).


### 14.3 Market Power on the Supply Side of Labor Markets: Unions

#### Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

-   Explain the concept of labor unions, including membership levels and

A labor union is an organization of workers that negotiates with
employers over wages and working conditions. A labor union seeks to
change the balance of power between employers and workers by requiring
employers to deal with workers collectively, rather than as individuals.
As such, a labor union operates like a monopoly in a labor market. We
sometimes call negotiations between unions and firms collective
bargaining.

The subject of labor unions can be controversial. Supporters of labor
unions view them as the workers' primary line of defense against efforts
by profit-seeking firms to hold down wages and benefits. Critics of
labor unions view them as having a tendency to grab as much as they can
in the short term, even if it means injuring workers in the long run by
driving firms into bankruptcy or by blocking the new technologies and
production methods that lead to economic growth. We will start with some
facts about union membership in the United States.

#### Facts about Union Membership and Pay

According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics, about 10.3% of all
U.S. workers belong to unions. This represents nearly a 50% reduction
since 1983 (the earliest year for which comparable data are available),
when union members were 20.1% of all workers. Following are some facts
about unions for 2021 (note that we are using the population categories
and group names utilized in the data collection and publication):

-   10.6% of U.S. male workers belong to unions; 9.9% of female workers
    do
-   10.7% of White workers, 12.3% of Black workers, and 9.8 % of
    Hispanic workers belong to unions
-   11.8% of full-time workers and 5.7% of part-time workers are union
    members
-   4.4% of workers ages 16--24 belong to unions, as do 13.2% of workers
    ages 45-54
-   Occupations in which relatively high percentages of workers belong
    to unions are the federal government (26.0% belong to a union),
    state government (29.9%), local government (41.7%); transportation
    and utilities (17.6%); natural resources, construction, and
    maintenance (15.9%); and production, transportation, and material
    moving (13.3%)
-   Occupations that have relatively low percentages of unionized
    workers are agricultural workers (1.7%), financial services (1.9%),
    professional and business services (2.2%), leisure and hospitality
    (2.2%), and wholesale and retail trade (4.5%)

In summary, the percentage of workers belonging to a union is higher for
men than women; higher for Black than for White or Hispanic people;
higher for the 45--64 age range; and higher among workers in government
and manufacturing than workers in agriculture or service-oriented jobs.

In terms of pay, benefits, and hiring, U.S. unions offer a good news/bad
news story. The good news for unions and their members is that their
members earn about 20% more than nonunion workers, even after adjusting
for factors such as years of work experience and education level. The
bad news for unions is that the share of U.S. workers who belong to a
labor union has been steadily declining for 50 years, as [Figure
14.11](#fig-14_11) shows. About one-quarter of all U.S. workers
belonged to a union in the mid-1950s, but only 10.3% of U.S. workers are
union members today. If you leave out government workers (which includes
teachers in public schools), only 6.1% of the workers employed by
private firms now work for a union.

Figure 14.11 Percentage of Wage and Salary Workers Who Are Union Members
The share of wage and salary workers who belong to unions rose sharply
in the 1930s and 1940s, but has tailed off since then to 10.3% of all
workers in 2021.

The following section analyzes the higher pay union workers receive
compared the pay rates for nonunion workers. The section after that
analyzes declining union membership levels. An overview of these two
issues will allow us to discuss many aspects of how unions work.

##### Higher Wages for Union Workers

How does a union affect wages and employment? Because a union is the
sole supplier of labor, it can act like a monopoly and ask for whatever
wage rate it can obtain for its workers. If employers need workers, they
have to meet the union's wage demand.

What are the limits on how much higher pay union workers can receive? To
analyze these questions, let's consider a situation where all firms in
an industry must negotiate with a single union, and no firm is allowed
to hire nonunion labor. If no labor union existed in this market, then
equilibrium (E) in the labor market would occur at the intersection of
the demand for labor (D) and the supply of labor (S) as we see in
[Figure 14.12](#fig-14_12). This is the same result as we showed
in Figure 14.6 above. The union can, however, threaten that, unless
firms agree to the wages they demand, the workers will strike. As a
result, the labor union manages to achieve, through negotiations with
the firms, a union wage of Wu for its members, above what the
equilibrium wage would otherwise have been.

![](media/14-3-market-power-on-the-supply-side-of-labor-markets-unions_rId26.jpeg){width="3.25in" height="2.89in" #fig-14_12}

Figure 14.12 Union Wage Negotiations Without a union, the equilibrium at
E would have involved the wage We and the quantity of labor Qe. However,
the union is able to use its bargaining power to raise the wage to Wu.
The result is an excess supply of labor for union jobs. That is, a
quantity of labor supplied, Qs is greater than firms' quantity demanded
for labor, Qd.

This labor market situation resembles what a monopoly firm does in
selling a product, but in this case a union is a monopoly selling labor
to firms. At the higher union wage Wu, the firms in this industry will
hire less labor than they would have hired in equilibrium. Moreover, an
excess supply of workers want union jobs, but firms will not be hiring
for such jobs.

From the union point of view, workers who receive higher wages are
better off. However, notice that the quantity of workers (Qd) hired at
the union wage Wu is smaller than the quantity Qe that the firm would
have hired at the original equilibrium wage. A sensible union must
recognize that when it pushes up the wage, it also reduces the firms'
incentive to hire. This situation does not necessarily mean that union
workers are fired. Instead, it may be that when union workers move on to
other jobs or retire, they are not always replaced, or perhaps when a
firm expands production, it expands employment somewhat less with a
higher union wage than it would have done with the lower equilibrium
wage. Other situations could be that a firm decides to purchase inputs
from nonunion producers, rather than producing them with its own highly
paid unionized workers, or perhaps the firm moves or opens a new
facility in a state or country where unions are less powerful.

From the firm's point of view, the key question is whether union
workers' higher wages are matched by higher productivity. If so, then
the firm can afford to pay the higher union wages and, the demand curve
for "unionized" labor could actually shift to the right. This could
reduce the job losses as the equilibrium employment level shifts to the
right and the difference between the equilibrium and the union wages
will have been reduced. If worker unionization does not increase
productivity, then the higher union wage will cause lower profits or
losses for the firm.

Union workers might have higher productivity than nonunion workers for a
number of reasons. First, higher wages may elicit higher productivity.
Second, union workers tend to stay longer at a given job, a trend that
reduces the employer's costs for training and hiring and results in
workers with more years of experience. Many unions also offer job
training and apprenticeship programs.

In addition, firms that are confronted with union demands for higher
wages may choose production methods that involve more physical capital
and less labor, resulting in increased labor productivity. @tbl-table_14_7 provides an example. Assume that a firm can produce a
home exercise cycle with three different combinations of labor and
manufacturing equipment. Say that the firm pays labor \$16 an hour
(including benefits) and the machines for manufacturing cost \$200 each.
Under these circumstances, the total cost of producing a home exercise
cycle will be lowest if the firm adopts the plan of 50 hours of labor
and one machine, as the table shows. Now, suppose that a union
negotiates a wage of \$20 an hour including benefits. In this case, it
makes no difference to the firm whether it uses more hours of labor and
fewer machines or less labor and more machines, although it might prefer
to use more machines and to hire fewer union workers. (After all,
machines never threaten to strike---but they do not buy the final
product or service either.)

In the final column of the table, the wage has risen to \$24 an hour. In
this case, the firm clearly has an incentive for using the plan that
involves paying for fewer hours of labor and using three machines. If
management responds to union demands for higher wages by investing more
in machinery, then union workers can be more productive because they are
working with more or better physical capital equipment than the typical
nonunion worker. However, the firm will need to hire fewer workers.

| Hours of Labor | Number of Machines | Cost of Labor + Cost of Machine $16/hour | Cost of Labor + Cost of Machine $20/hour | Cost of Labor + Cost of Machine $24/hour |
|----------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 30             | 3                   | $480 + $600 = $1,080                       | $600 + $600 = $1,200                       | $720 + $600 = $1,320                       |
| 40             | 2                   | $640 + $400 = $1,040                       | $800 + $400 = $1,200                       | $960 + $400 = $1,360                       |
| 50             | 1                   | $800 + $200 = $1,000                       | $1,000 + $200 = $1,200                     | $1,200 + $200 = $1,400                     |

: Three Production Choices to Manufacture a Home Exercise Cycle {#tbl-table_14_7}

In some cases, unions have discouraged the use of labor-saving physical
capital equipment---out of the reasonable fear that new machinery will
reduce the number of union jobs. For example, in 2015, the union
representing longshoremen who unload ships and the firms that operate
shipping companies and port facilities staged a work stoppage that shut
down the ports on the western coast of the United States. Two key issues
in the dispute were the desire of the shipping companies and port
operators to use handheld scanners for record-keeping and
computer-operated cabs for loading and unloading ships---changes which
the union opposed, along with overtime pay. President Obama threatened
to use the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947---commonly known as
the Taft-Hartley Act---where a court can impose an 80-day "cooling-off
period" in order to allow time for negotiations to proceed without the
threat of a work stoppage. Federal mediators were called in, and the two
sides agreed to a deal in February 2015. The ultimate agreement allowed
the new technologies, but also kept wages, health, and pension benefits
high for workers. In the past, presidential use of the Taft-Hartley Act
sometimes has made labor negotiations more bitter and argumentative but,
in this case, it seems to have smoothed the road to an agreement.

In other instances, unions have proved quite willing to adopt new
technologies. In one prominent example, during the 1950s and 1960s, the
United Mineworkers union demanded that mining companies install
labor-saving machinery in the mines. The mineworkers' union realized
that over time, the new machines would reduce the number of jobs in the
mines, but the union leaders also knew that the mine owners would have
to pay higher wages if the workers became more productive, and
mechanization was a necessary step toward greater productivity.

In fact, in some cases union workers may be more willing to accept new
technology than nonunion workers, because the union workers believe that
the union will negotiate to protect their jobs and wages, whereas
nonunion workers may be more concerned that the new technology will
replace their jobs. In addition, union workers, who typically have
higher job market experience and training, are likely to suffer less and
benefit more than non-union workers from the introduction of new
technology. Overall, it is hard to make a definitive case that union
workers as a group are always either more or less welcoming to new
technology than are nonunion workers

##### The Decline in U.S. Union Membership

The proportion of U.S. workers belonging to unions has declined
dramatically since the early 1950s. Economists have offered a number of
possible explanations:

-   The shift from manufacturing to service industries
-   The force of globalization and increased competition from foreign
    producers
-   A reduced desire for unions because of the workplace protection laws
    now in place
-   U.S. legal environment that makes it relatively more difficult for
    unions to organize workers and expand their membership

Let's discuss each of these four explanations in more detail.

A first possible explanation for the decline in the share of U.S.
workers belonging to unions involves the patterns of job growth in the
manufacturing and service sectors of the economy as [Figure
14.13](#fig-14_13) shows. The U.S. economy had about 15 million
manufacturing jobs in 1960. This total rose to 19 million by the late
1970s and then declined to 17 million in 2013. Meanwhile, the number of
jobs in service industries (including government employment) rose from
35 million in 1960 to over 118 million by 2013, according to the Bureau
of Labor Statistics. Because over time unions were stronger in
manufacturing than in service industries, the growth in jobs was not
happening where the unions were. It is interesting to note that
government workers comprise several of the biggest unions in the
country, including the American Federation of State, County and
Municipal Employees (AFSCME); the Service Employees International Union;
and the National Education Association. @tbl-table_14_8 lists the
membership of each of these unions. Outside of government employees,
however, unions have not had great success in organizing the service
sector.

![](media/14-3-market-power-on-the-supply-side-of-labor-markets-unions_rId35.jpeg){width="6.5in" height="3.855in" #fig-14_13}

Figure 14.13 The Growth of Service Jobs Jobs in services have increased
dramatically for more than the past 50 years. Jobs in government have
increased modestly until 1990 and then declined slightly since then.
Jobs in manufacturing peaked in the late 1970s and have declined more
than a third since then.

A second explanation for the decline in the share of unionized workers
looks at import competition. Starting in the 1960s, U.S. carmakers and
steelmakers faced increasing competition from Japanese and European
manufacturers. As sales of imported cars and steel rose, the number of
jobs in U.S. auto manufacturing fell. This industry is heavily
unionized. Not surprisingly, membership in the United Auto Workers,
which was 975,000 in 1985, had fallen to roughly 390,000 by 2015. Import
competition not only decreases the employment in sectors where unions
were once strong, but also decreases the bargaining power of unions in
those sectors. However, as we have seen, unions that organize
public-sector workers, who are not threatened by import competition,
have continued to see growth.

A third possible reason for the decline in the number of union workers
is that citizens often call on their elected representatives to pass
laws concerning work conditions, overtime, parental leave, regulation of
pensions, and other issues. Unions offered strong political support for
these laws aimed at protecting workers but, in an ironic twist, the
passage of those laws then made many workers feel less need for unions.

These first three possible reasons for the decline of unions are all
somewhat plausible, but they have a common problem. Most other developed
economies have experienced similar economic and political trends, such
as the shift from manufacturing to services, globalization, and
increasing government social benefits and regulation of the workplace.
Clearly there are cultural differences between countries as to their
acceptance of unions in the workplace. The share of the population
belonging to unions in other countries is very high compared with the
share in the United States. @tbl-table_14_8 shows the proportion
of workers in a number of the world's high-income economies who belong
to unions. The United States is near the bottom, along with France and
Spain. The last column shows union coverage, defined as including those
workers whose wages are determined by a union negotiation even if the
workers do not officially belong to the union. In the United States,
union membership is almost identical to union coverage. However, in many
countries, the wages of many workers who do not officially belong to a
union are still determined by collective bargaining between unions and
firms.

: International Comparisons of Union Membership and Coverage in
2012 (Source, CIA World Factbook, retrieved from www.cia.gov) {#tbl-table_14_8}

These international differences in union membership suggest a fourth
reason for the decline of union membership in the United States: perhaps
U.S. laws are less friendly to the formation of unions than such laws in
other countries. The close connection between union membership and a
friendly legal environment is apparent in the history of U.S. unions.
The great rise in union membership in the 1930s followed the passage of
the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, which specified that workers
had a right to organize unions and that management had to give them a
fair chance to do so. The U.S. government strongly encouraged forming
unions during the early 1940s in the belief that unions would help to
coordinate the all-out production efforts needed during World War II.
However, after World War II came the passage of the Taft-Hartley Act of
1947, which gave states the power to allow workers to opt out of the
union in their workplace if they so desired. This law made the legal
climate less encouraging to those seeking to form unions, and union
membership levels soon started declining.

The procedures for forming a union differ substantially from country to
country. For example, the procedures in the United States and those in
Canada are strikingly different. When a group of workers wishes to form
a union in the United States, they announce this fact and set an
election date when the firm\'s employees will vote in a secret ballot on
whether to form a union. Supporters of the union lobby for a "yes" vote,
and the firm\'s management lobbies for a "no" vote---often even hiring
outside consultants for assistance in swaying workers to vote "no." In
Canada, by contrast, a union is formed when a sufficient proportion of
workers (usually about 60%) signs an official card saying that they want
a union. There is no separate "election date." The management of
Canadian firms is limited by law in its ability to lobby against the
union. In addition, although it is illegal to discriminate and fire
workers based on their union activity in the United States, the
penalties are slight, making this a not so costly way of deterring union
activity. In short, forming unions is easier in Canada---and in many
other countries---than in the United States.

In summary, union membership in the United States is lower than in many
other high-income countries, a difference that may be due to different
legal environments and cultural attitudes toward unions.

### 14.4 Bilateral Monopoly

#### Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to explain:

-   How firms determine wages and employment when a specific labor
    market combines a union and a monopsony

What happens when there is market power on both sides of the labor
market, in other words, when a union meets a monopsony? Economists call
such a situation a bilateral monopoly.

![](media/14-4-bilateral-monopoly_rId23.jpeg){width="3.25in" height="2.405in" #fig-14_14}

Figure 14.14 Bilateral Monopoly Employment, L\*, will be lower in a
bilateral monopoly than in a competitive labor market, but the
equilibrium wage is indeterminate, somewhere in the range between Wu,
what the union would choose, and Wm, what the monopsony would choose.

[Figure 14.14](#fig-14_14) is a combination of Figure 14.6 and Figure
14.11. A monopsony wants to reduce wages as well as employment, Wm and
L\* in the figure. A union wants to increase wages, but at the cost of
lower employment, Wu and L\* in the figure. Since both sides want to
reduce employment, we can be sure that the outcome will be lower
employment compared to a competitive labor market. What happens to the
wage, though, is based on the monopsonist's relative bargaining power
compared to the bargaining power of the union. The actual outcome is
indeterminate in the graph, but it will be closer to Wu if the union has
more power and closer to Wm if the monopsonist has more power.


### 14.5 Employment Discrimination

#### Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

-   Analyze earnings gaps based on race and gender
-   Explain the impact of discrimination in a competitive market
-   Identify U.S. public policies designed to reduce discrimination

Barriers to equitable participation in the labor market drive down
economic growth. When certain populations are underrepresented,
underpaid, or mistreated in a labor market or industry, the negative
outcomes can effect the larger economy. For example, many science and
technology fields were either unwelcoming or overtly unaccepting of
women and people of color. Some major contributors to these fields
overcame these challenges. Mexican-American scientist Lydia
Villa-Komaroff, for example, faced overt discrimination when her college
advisor told her not to pursue chemistry because women didn\'t
\"belong\" in chemistry. She pursued biology instead; she developed the
first instance of synthetic insulin (the chemical that people with
diabetes need in order to survive) through a process that has saved
million of lives and is credited with launching the entire industry of
biotechnology---one of the most important in the U.S. economy. But for
every Villa-Komaroff, there have been thousands of women who were
prevented from making those contributions. Beyond the personal impact on
those people, consider the impact on those scientific fields, our
overall quality of life, and the economy itself. Economist Lisa D. Cook
has quantified the costs of these innovation losses. She estimates that
GDP could be as much as 4.4% higher if women and people from minority
populations were fully able to participate in the science and technology
innovation process.

Discrimination involves acting on the belief that members of a certain
group are inferior or deserve less solely because of a factor such as
race, gender, or religion. There are many types of discrimination but
the focus here will be on discrimination in labor markets, which arises
if workers with the same skill levels---as measured by education,
experience, and expertise---receive different pay or have different job
opportunities because of their race or gender. Much of the data
collected and published on these topics are limited in terms of the
diversity of people represented, and focus particularly on binary
gender, single-race, and single-ethnicity identities. While these
characterizations do not capture the diversity of Americans, the
findings are important in order to understand discrimination and other
practices, and to consider the impacts of policies and changes. Also,
while sex and gender are different, many data sets, laws, court
decisions, and media accounts use the terms interchangeably. For
consistency, we will use the terminology found in the source material
and government data.

#### Earnings Gaps by Race and Gender

A possible signal of labor market discrimination is when an employer
pays one group less than another. [Figure 14.15](#fig-14_15)
shows the average wage of Black workers as a ratio of the average wage
of White workers and the average wage of female workers as a ratio of
the average wage of male workers. Research by the economists Francine
Blau and Laurence Kahn shows that the gap between the earnings of women
and men did not move much in the 1970s, but has declined since the
1980s. Detailed analysis by economists Kerwin Kofi Charles and Patrick
Bayer show that the gap between the earnings of Black and White people
diminished in the 1970s, but grew again so that current differences are
as wide as they were nearly 70 years ago. In both gender and race, an
earnings gap remains.

Figure 14.15 Wage Ratios by Sex and Race The ratio of wages for Black
workers to White workers rose substantially in the late 1960s and
through the 1970s. The 1990s saw a peak above 80% followed by a bumpy
decline to the low 70s. The ratio of wages for female to male workers
changed little through the 1970s. In both cases, a gap remains between
the average wages of Black and White workers and between the average
wages of female and male workers. Source: U.S. Department of Labor,
Bureau of Labor Statistics.

An earnings gap between average wages, in and of itself, does not prove
that discrimination is occurring in the labor market. We need to apply
the same productivity characteristics to all parties (employees)
involved. Gender discrimination in the labor market occurs when
employers pay people of a specific gender less despite those people
having comparable levels of education, experience, and expertise. (Read
the Clear It Up about the sex-discrimination suit brought against
Walmart.) Similarly, racial discrimination in the labor market exists
when employers pay racially diverse employees less than their coworkers
of the majority race despite having comparable levels of education,
experience, and expertise. To bring a successful gender discrimination
lawsuit, an employee must prove the employer is paying them less than an
employee of a different gender who holds a similar job, with similar
educational attainment, and with similar expertise. Likewise, someone
who wants to sue on the grounds of racial discrimination must prove that
the employer pays them less than an employee of another race who holds a
similar job, with similar educational attainment, and with similar
expertise.

The FRED database includes earnings data at [earnings by age, gender and
race/ethnicity](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/categories/33501).

As stated previously and as we will see below, not every instance of a
wage gap or employment inequity is a product of overt discrimination on
the part of individual employers. Significant overall issues in
societies, such as inequitable education or housing segregation, can
lead to earning gaps and limitations on economic mobility. However,
these wider issues usually affect people from minority populations
and/or those who have been historically underrepresented in positions of
power. Economist William A. Darity Jr., whose work is discussed in more
detail below, indicates that individualized employer racism still
exists, but it is largely practiced in \"covert and subtle forms.\"

#### Clear It Up {#clear-it-up .Heading3Grey}

##### What was the sex-discrimination case against Walmart? {#what-was-the-sex-discrimination-case-against-walmart .Heading4Grey}

In one of the largest class-action sex-discrimination cases in U.S.
history, 1.2 million female employees of Walmart claimed that the
company engaged in wage and promotion discrimination. In 2011, the
Supreme Court threw out the case on the grounds that the group was too
large and too diverse to consider the case a class action suit. Lawyers
for the women regrouped and were subsequently suing in smaller groups.
Part of the difficulty for the female employees is that the court said
that local managers made pay and promotion decisions that were not
necessarily the company\'s policies as a whole. Consequently, female
Walmart employees in Texas argued that their new suit would challenge
the management of a "discrete group of regional district and store
managers." They claimed that these managers made biased pay and
promotion decisions. However, in 2013, a federal district court rejected
a smaller California class action suit against the company.

On other issues, Walmart made the news again in 2013 when the National
Labor Relations Board found Walmart guilty of illegally penalizing and
firing workers who took part in labor protests and strikes. Walmart paid
\$11.7 million in back wages and compensation damages to women in
Kentucky who were denied jobs due to their sex. And in 2020, a sex-based
hiring discrimination lawsuit was filed by the U.S. Equal Employ­ment
Opportunity Commission (EEOC), in which the EEOC alleged that Walmart
conducted a physical ability test (known as the PAT) as a requirement
for applicants to be hired as order fillers at Walmart's grocery
distribution centers nationwide, and that the PAT disproportionately
excluded female applicants from jobs as grocery order fillers. In
September 2020, Walmart and the EEOC agreed to a consent decree, which
requires Walmart to cease all physical ability testing that had been
used for purposes of hiring grocery distribution center order fillers.
The decree also required Walmart to pay \$20 million into a settlement
fund to pay lost wages to women across the country who were denied
grocery order filler positions because of the testing.

#### Investigating the Female/Male Earnings Gap

As a result of changes in law and culture, women began to enter the paid
workforce in substantial numbers in the mid- to late-twentieth century.
As of February 2022, 56.0% of women aged 20 and over held jobs, while
67.6% of men aged 20 and over did. Moreover, along with entering the
workforce, women began to ratchet up their education levels. In 1971,
44% of undergraduate college degrees went to women. As of the 2018--19
academic year, women earned 57% of bachelor's degrees. In 1970, women
received 5.4% of the degrees from law schools and 8.4% of the degrees
from medical schools. By 2017, women were receiving just over 50% of the
law degrees, and by 2019, 48% of the medical degrees. There are now
slightly more women than men in both law schools and medical schools.
These gains in education and experience have reduced the female/male
wage gap over time. However, concerns remain about the extent to which
women have not yet assumed a substantial share of the positions at the
top of the largest companies or in the U.S. Congress.

There are factors that can lower women's average wages. Women are likely
to bear a disproportionately large share of household responsibilities.
A mother of young children is more likely to drop out of the labor force
for several years or work on a reduced schedule than is the father. As a
result, women in their 30s and 40s are likely, on average, to have less
job experience than men. In the United States, childless women with the
same education and experience levels as men are typically paid
comparably. However, women with families and children are typically paid
about 7% to 14% less than other women of similar education and work
experience. Meanwhile, married men earn about 10% to 15% more than
single men with comparable education and work experience. This
circumstance or practice is often referred to as the \"motherhood
penalty\" and the \"fatherhood bonus.\"

Another aspect of the gender pay gap relates to work that isn't actually
paid, such as household chores, caring for children and other family
members, and cooking. Studies have found that globally and within the
United States, women undertake far more of this work than do men; even
women who work full time and/or bring in the majority of family income
take on more of this unpaid work than the men in their households.

Economists study many aspects of sex- and gender-based earnings gaps,
often revealing unexpected causes and impacts. For example, economists
Jessica Pan, Jonathan Guryan, and Kerwin Kofi Charles analyzed decades
of sociological and employment data and uncovered that the amount of
sexism in the U.S. state where a woman was born is an indicator of the
woman\'s earnings throughout her life, even if she moves away from her
home state. In other words, women born in states with more pronounced
sexist attitudes earn less, no matter where they live later on. Other
economists showed that from 1950--2000, as women\'s representation
increased in the workforce, jobs that became occupied by women
experienced wage reductions relative to jobs being done by men---an
outcome often referred to as \"devaluation.\" The value of this research
and similar investigations comes from the deeper understanding of the
origins of the earnings gap, so that workers, employers, and governments
can take steps to address them.

#### Investigating the Earnings Gap Related to Race and Ethnicity

Black people experienced blatant labor market discrimination during much
of the twentieth century. Until the passage of the Civil Rights Act of
1964, it was legal in many states to refuse to hire a Black worker,
regardless of the credentials or experience of that worker. Moreover,
Black people were often denied access to educational opportunities,
which in turn meant that they had lower levels of qualifications for
many jobs. At least one economic study has shown that the 1964 law is
partially responsible for the narrowing of the gap in Black--White
earnings in the late 1960s and into the 1970s. For example, the ratio of
total earnings of Black male workers to White male workers rose from 62%
in 1964 to 75.3% in 2013, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

However, the earnings gap between Black and White workers has not
changed as much as the earnings gap between men and women has in the
last half century. The remaining racial gap seems related both to
continuing differences in education levels and to the presence of
discrimination. @tbl-table_14_9 shows that the percentage of
Black people who complete a four-year college degree remains
substantially lower than the percentage of White people who complete
college. According to the U.S. Census, both White and Black people have
higher levels of educational attainment than Hispanic people and lower
levels than Asian people. The lower average levels of education for
Black workers surely explain part of the earnings gap. In fact, Black
women who have the same levels of education and experience as White
women receive, on average, about the same level of pay. One study shows
that White and Black college graduates have identical salaries
immediately after college; however, the racial wage gap widens over
time, an outcome that suggests the possibility of continuing
discrimination. Other researchers conducted a field experiment by
responding to job advertisements with fictitious resumes using names
that were either commonly associated with Black/African American people
or names commonly associated with White people; they found that the
White-associated names received 50 percent more callbacks for
interviews. This is suggestive of discrimination in job opportunities.
Further, as the following Clear It Up feature explains, there is
evidence to support that discrimination in the housing market is
connected to employment discrimination.

|                                 | White | Hispanic | Black | Asian |
|---------------------------------|-------|----------|-------|-------|
| Completed four years of high school or more | 93.8% | 73.0%    | 87.2% | 91.0% |
| Completed four years of college or more     | 37.6% | 16.8%    | 23.7% | 54.7% |

#### Clear It Up {#clear-it-up-1 .Heading3Grey}

##### How is discrimination in the housing market connected to employment discrimination? {#how-is-discrimination-in-the-housing-market-connected-to-employment-discrimination .Heading4Grey}

A recent study by the Housing and Urban Development (HUD) department
found that realtors showed Black homebuyers 18 percent fewer homes
compared to White homebuyers. Realtors showed Asian homebuyers 19
percent fewer properties. Additionally, Hispanic people experience more
discrimination in renting apartments and undergo stiffer credit checks
than White renters. In a 2012 study by the U.S. Department of Housing
and Urban Development and the nonprofit Urban Institute, Hispanic
testers who contacted agents about advertised rental units received
information about 12 percent fewer units available and were shown seven
percent fewer units than White renters. The \$9 million study, based on
research in 28 metropolitan areas, concluded that blatant "door
slamming" forms of discrimination are on the decline but that the
discrimination that does exist is harder to detect, and as a result,
more difficult to remedy. According to the *Chicago Tribune*, HUD
Secretary Shaun Donovan, who served in his role from 2009-2014, told
reporters, "Just because it's taken on a hidden form doesn't make it any
less harmful. You might not be able to move into that community with the
good schools."

These practices are viewed as a continuation of redlining, which is the
intentional and discriminatory withholding of services or products based
on race or other factors. Redlining was practiced extensively by banks
and other lenders who refused to issue mortgages or other loans to
people from racial or ethnic minorities living in neighborhoods that
were deemed \"hazardous\" to investment, even though the same lenders
would issue loans to White people with similar economic status.
Redlining has lasting effects today, demonstrated by significant divides
in educational and financial opportunity in certain neighborhoods or
cities.

The lower levels of education for Black workers can also be a result of
discrimination---although it may be pre-labor market discrimination,
rather than direct discrimination by employers in the labor market. For
example, if redlining and other discrimination in housing markets causes
Black families to live clustered together in certain neighborhoods and
those areas have under-resourced schools, then those children will
continue to have lower educational attainment then their White
counterparts and, consequently, not be able to obtain the higher paying
jobs that require higher levels of education. Another element to
consider is that in the past, when Black people were effectively barred
from many high-paying jobs, obtaining additional education could have
seemed not to be worth the investment, because the educational degrees
would not pay off. While the government has legally abolished
discriminatory labor practices, structures and systems take a very long
time to eradicate.

#### Competitive Markets and Discrimination

Gary Becker (1930--2014), who won the Nobel Prize in economics in 1992,
was one of the first to analyze discrimination in economic terms. Becker
pointed out that while competitive markets can allow some employers to
practice discrimination, it can also provide profit-seeking firms with
incentives not to discriminate. Given these incentives, Becker explored
the question of why discrimination persists.

If a business is located in an area with a large minority population and
refuses to sell to minorities, it will cut into its own profits. If some
businesses run by bigoted employers refuse to pay women and/or
minorities a wage based on their productivity, then other profit-seeking
employers can hire these workers. In a competitive market, if the
business owners care more about the color of money than about the color
of skin, they will have an incentive to make buying, selling, hiring,
and promotion decisions strictly based on economic factors.

Do not underestimate the power of markets to offer at least a degree of
freedom to oppressed groups. In many countries, cohesive minority
population groups like Jewish people and emigrant Chinese people have
managed to carve out a space for themselves through their economic
activities, despite legal and social discrimination against them. Many
immigrants, including those who come to the United States, have taken
advantage of economic freedom to make new lives for themselves. However,
history teaches that market forces alone are unlikely to eliminate
discrimination. After all, discrimination against African Americans
persisted in the market-oriented U.S. economy during the century between
the ratification of the 13th Amendment, which abolished slavery in 1865,
and the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964---and has continued
since then, too.

Why does discrimination persist in competitive markets? Gary Becker
sought to explain this persistence. Discriminatory impulses can emerge
at a number of levels: among managers, among workers, and among
customers. Consider the situation of a store owner or manager who is not
personally prejudiced, but who has many customers who are prejudiced. If
that manager treats all groups fairly, the manager may find it drives
away prejudiced customers. In such a situation, a policy of
nondiscrimination could reduce the firm's profits. After all, a business
firm is part of society, and a firm that does not follow the societal
norms is likely to suffer.

As economist William A. Darity Jr. points out, however, the \"prejudiced
customer\" rationale falls apart when considering the many jobs that
have no customer contact. Darity examined several theories regarding the
persistence of employment discrimination, including rationales regarding
group membership and employers\' lack of information about candidates of
other genders or races. Darity also directly studies and interprets
others\' work on discrimination in other countries, such as wage
disparities between Sikh and Hindu men in India. Darity concludes that
the competitive forces of the market have not been enough to overcome
employment and wage discrimination, and, on their own, are unlikely to
end such discrimination in the future.

about wage discrimination.

#### Public Policies to Reduce Discrimination

A first public policy step against discrimination in the labor market is
to make it illegal. For example, the Equal Pay Act of 1963 said that
employers must pay men and women who do equal work the same. The Civil
Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employment discrimination based on race,
color, religion, sex, or national origin. The Age Discrimination in
Employment Act of 1967 prohibited discrimination on the basis of age
against individuals who are 40 years of age or older. The Civil Rights
Act of 1991 provides monetary damages in cases of intentional employment
discrimination. The Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 was aimed at
prohibiting discrimination against people in the workplace who are
planning pregnancy, are pregnant, or are returning after pregnancy.
Passing a law, however, is only part of the answer, since discrimination
by prejudiced employers may be less important than broader social
patterns and systems.

The 1964 Civil Rights Act created an important government organization,
the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, to investigate employment
discrimination and protect workers who filed complaints against
employers. Economist Phyllis Ann Wallace, who had previously worked for
U.S. intelligence services, was appointed as the commission\'s chief of
technical studies. In this role she collected and organized a massive
amount of public and private sector data, as well as mentored and
directed economists and other analysts in their investigations.

These laws against discrimination have reduced the gender wage gap. A
2007 Department of Labor study compared salaries of men and women who
have similar educational achievement, work experience, and occupation
and found that the gender wage gap is only 5%.

In the case of the earnings gap between Black people and White people
(and also between Hispanic people and White people), probably the single
largest step that could be taken at this point in U.S. history to close
the earnings gap would be to reduce the gap in educational attainment.
Part of the answer to this issue involves finding ways to improve the
performance of schools, which is a highly controversial topic in itself.
In addition, the education gap is unlikely to close unless Black and
Hispanic families and peer groups strengthen their culture of support
for educational attainment.

Affirmative action is the name given to active efforts by government or
businesses that give special rights to minorities in hiring and
promotion to make up for past discrimination. Affirmative action, in its
limited and not especially controversial form, means making an effort to
reach out to a broader range of minority candidates for jobs. In its
more aggressive and controversial form, affirmative action required
government and companies to hire a specific number or percentage of
minority employees. However, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled against
state affirmative action laws. Today, the government applies affirmative
action policies only to federal contractors who have lost a
discrimination lawsuit. The federal Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission (EEOC) enforces this type of redress.

#### An Increasingly Diverse Workforce

Racial and ethnic diversity is on the rise in the U.S. population and
workforce. As [Figure 14.16](#fig-14_16) shows, while the White
Americans comprised 78% of the population in 2012, the U.S. Bureau of
the Census projects that Whites will comprise 69% of the U.S. population
by 2060. Forecasters predict that the proportion of U.S. citizens who
are of Hispanic background to rise substantially. Moreover, in addition
to expected changes in the population, workforce diversity is increasing
as the women who entered the workforce in the 1970s and 1980s are now
moving up the promotion ladders within their organizations.

![](media/14-5-employment-discrimination_rId54.jpeg){width="4.88in" height="2.68in" #fig-14_16}

This figure shows projected changes in the ethnic makeup of the U.S.
population by 2060. Note that "NHPI" stands for Native Hawaiian and
Other Pacific Islander. "AIAN" stands for American Indian and Alaska
Native. Source: US Department of Commerce

Regarding the future, optimists argue that the growing proportions of
minority workers will break down remaining discriminatory barriers. The
economy will benefit as an increasing proportion of workers from
traditionally disadvantaged groups have a greater opportunity to fulfill
their potential. Pessimists worry that the social tensions between
different genders and between ethnic groups will rise and that workers
will be less productive as a result. Anti-discrimination policy, at its
best, seeks to help society move toward the more optimistic outcome.

### 14.6 Immigration

Most Americans would be outraged if a law prevented them from moving to
another city or another state. However, when the conversation turns to
crossing national borders and is about other people arriving in the
United States, laws preventing such movement often seem more reasonable.
Some of the tensions over immigration stem from worries over how it
might affect a country's culture, including differences in language, and
patterns of family, authority, or gender relationships. Economics does
not have much to say about such cultural issues. Some of the worries
about immigration do, however, have to do with its effects on wages and
income levels, and how it affects government taxes and spending. On
those topics, economists have insights and research to offer.

#### Historical Patterns of Immigration

Supporters and opponents of immigration look at the same data and see
different patterns. Those who express concern about immigration levels
to the United States point to graphics like [Figure
14.17](#fig-14_17) which shows total inflows of immigrants decade
by decade through the twentieth and into the twenty-first century.
Clearly, the level of immigration has been high and rising in recent
years, reaching and exceeding the towering levels of the early twentieth
century. However, those who are less worried about immigration point out
that the high immigration levels of the early twentieth century happened
when total population was much lower. Since the U.S. population roughly
tripled during the twentieth century, the seemingly high levels in
immigration in the 1990s and 2000s look relatively smaller when they are
divided by the population.

![](media/14-6-immigration_rId21.jpeg){width="5.3in" height="2.41in" #fig-14_17}

Figure 14.17 Immigration Since 1900 The number of immigrants in each
decade declined between 1900 and the 1940s, rose sharply through 2009
and started to decline from 2010 to the present. (Source: U.S. Census)

From where have the immigrants come? Immigrants from Europe were more
than 90% of the total in the first decade of the twentieth century, but
less than 20% of the total by the end of the century. By the 2000s,
about half of U.S. immigration came from the rest of the Americas,
especially Mexico, and about a quarter came from various countries in
Asia.

#### Economic Effects of Immigration

A surge of immigration can affect the economy in a number of different
ways. In this section, we will consider how immigrants might benefit the
rest of the economy, how they might affect wage levels, and how they
might affect government spending at the federal and local level.

To understand the economic consequences of immigration, consider the
following scenario. Imagine that the immigrants entering the United
States matched the existing U.S. population in age range, education,
skill levels, family size, and occupations. How would immigration of
this type affect the rest of the U.S. economy? Immigrants themselves
would be much better off, because their standard of living would be
higher in the United States. Immigrants would contribute to both
increased production and increased consumption. Given enough time for
adjustment, the range of jobs performed, income earned, taxes paid, and
public services needed would not be much affected by this kind of
immigration. It would be as if the population simply increased a little.

Now, consider the reality of recent immigration to the United States.
Immigrants are not identical to the rest of the U.S. population. About
one-third of immigrants over the age of 25 lack a high school diploma.
As a result, many of the recent immigrants end up in jobs like
restaurant and hotel work, lawn care, and janitorial work. This kind of
immigration represents a shift to the right in the supply of unskilled
labor for a number of jobs, which will lead to lower wages for these
jobs. The middle- and upper-income households that purchase the services
of these unskilled workers will benefit from these lower wages. However,
low-skilled U.S. workers who must compete with low-skilled immigrants
for jobs will tend to be negatively impacted by immigration.

The difficult policy questions about immigration are not so much about
the overall gains to the rest of the economy, which seem to be real but
small in the context of the U.S. economy, as they are about the
disruptive effects of immigration in specific labor markets. One
disruptive effect, as we noted, is that immigration weighted toward
low-skill workers tends to reduce wages for domestic low-skill workers.
A study by Michael S. Clune found that for each 10% rise in the number
of employed immigrants with no more than a high school diploma in the
labor market, high school students reduced their annual number of hours
worked by 3%. The effects on wages of low-skill workers are not
large---perhaps in the range of decline of about 1%. These effects are
likely kept low, in part, because of the legal floor of federal and
state minimum wage laws. In addition, immigrants are also thought to
contribute to increased demand for local goods and services which can
stimulate the local low skilled labor market. It is also possible that
employers, in the face of abundant low-skill workers, may choose
production processes which are more labor intensive than otherwise would
have been. These various factors would explain the small negative wage
effect that the native low-skill workers observed as a result of
immigration.

Another potential disruptive effect is the impact on state and local
government budgets. Many of the costs imposed by immigrants are costs
that arise in state-run programs, like the cost of public schooling and
of welfare benefits. However, many of the taxes that immigrants pay are
federal taxes like income taxes and Social Security taxes. Many
immigrants do not own property (such as homes and cars), so they do not
pay property taxes, which are one of the main sources of state and local
tax revenue. However, they do pay sales taxes, which are state and
local, and the landlords of property they rent pay property taxes.
According to the nonprofit Rand Corporation, the effects of immigration
on taxes are generally positive at the federal level, but they are
negative at the state and local levels in places where there are many
low-skilled immigrants.

regarding immigration.

#### Proposals for Immigration Reform

The Congressional Jordan Commission of the 1990s proposed reducing
overall levels of immigration and refocusing U.S. immigration policy to
give priority to immigrants with higher skill levels. In the labor
market, focusing on high-skilled immigrants would help prevent any
negative effects on low-skilled workers\' wages. For government budgets,
higher-skilled workers find jobs more quickly, earn higher wages, and
pay more in taxes. Several other immigration-friendly countries, notably
Canada and Australia, have immigration systems where those with high
levels of education or job skills have a much better chance of obtaining
permission to immigrate. For the United States, high tech companies
regularly ask for a more lenient immigration policy to admit a greater
quantity of highly skilled workers under the H1B visa program.

The Obama Administration proposed the so-called "DREAM Act" legislation,
which would have offered a path to citizenship for those classified as
illegal immigrants who were brought to the United States before the age
of 16. Despite bipartisan support, the legislation failed to pass at the
federal level. However, some state legislatures, such as California,
have passed their own Dream Acts.

Between its plans for a border wall, increased deportation of
undocumented immigrants, and even reductions in the number of highly
skilled legal H1B immigrants, the Trump Administration had a much less
positive approach to immigration. Most economists, whether conservative
or liberal, believe that while immigration harms some domestic workers,
the benefits to the nation exceed the costs. President Biden has been
considerably more positive about immigration than his predecessor.
However, given the presence of considerable disagreement within the
overall population about the desirability of immigration, it is unlikely
that any significant immigration reform will take place in the near
future.

#### Bring It Home {#bring-it-home .Heading3Grey}

##### The Increasing Value of a College Degree  {#the-increasing-value-of-a-college-degree .Heading4Grey}

The cost of college has increased dramatically in recent decades,
causing many college students to take student loans to afford it.
Despite this, the value of a college degree has never been higher. How
can we explain this?

We can estimate the value of a bachelor's degree as the difference in
lifetime earnings between the average holder of a bachelor's degree and
the average high school graduate. According to a 2021 report from the
Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce, adults with
a bachelor's degree earn an average of \$2.8 million during their
careers, \$1.2 million more than the median for workers with a high
school diploma. College graduates also have a significantly lower
unemployment rate than those with lower educational attainments.

While a college degree holder's wages have increased somewhat, the major
reason for the increase in value of a bachelor's degree has been the
plummeting value of a high school diploma. In the twenty-first century,
the majority of jobs require at least some post-secondary education.
This includes manufacturing jobs that in the past would have afforded
workers a middle class income with only a high school diploma. Those
jobs are increasingly scarce. This phenomenon has also no doubt
contributed to the increasing inequality of income that we observe in
the U.S. today. We will discuss that topic next, in Chapter 15.
