## 9.2 How a Profit-Maximizing Monopoly Chooses Output and Price

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

-   Explain the perceived demand curve for a perfect competitor and a
    monopoly
-   Analyze a demand curve for a monopoly and determine the output that
    maximizes profit and revenue
-   Calculate marginal revenue and marginal cost
-   Explain allocative efficiency as it pertains to the efficiency of a
    monopoly

Consider a monopoly firm, comfortably surrounded by barriers to entry so
that it need not fear competition from other producers. How will this
monopoly choose its profit-maximizing quantity of output, and what price
will it charge? Profits for the monopolist, like any firm, will be equal
to total revenues minus total costs. We can analyze the pattern of costs
for the monopoly within the same framework as the costs of a perfectly
competitive firm---that is, by using total cost, fixed cost, variable
cost, marginal cost, average cost, and average variable cost. However,
because a monopoly faces no competition, its situation and its decision
process will differ from that of a perfectly competitive firm. (The
Clear It Up feature discusses how hard it is sometimes to define
"market" in a monopoly situation.)

### Demand Curves Perceived by a Perfectly Competitive Firm and by a Monopoly

A perfectly competitive firm acts as a price taker, so we calculate
total revenue taking the given market price and multiplying it by the
quantity of output that the firm chooses. The demand curve *as it is
perceived by a perfectly competitive firm* appears in [Figure
9.3](#CNX_Econ_C09_008) (a). The flat perceived demand curve means that,
from the viewpoint of the perfectly competitive firm, it could sell
either a relatively low quantity like Ql or a relatively high quantity
like Qh at the market price P.

Figure 9.3 The Perceived Demand Curve for a Perfect Competitor and a
Monopolist (a) A perfectly competitive firm perceives the demand curve
that it faces to be flat. The flat shape means that the firm can sell
either a low quantity (Ql) or a high quantity (Qh) at exactly the same
price (P). (b) A monopolist perceives the demand curve that it faces to
be the same as the market demand curve, which for most goods is
downward-sloping. Thus, if the monopolist chooses a high level of output
(Qh), it can charge only a relatively low price (PI). Conversely, if the
monopolist chooses a low level of output (Ql), it can then charge a
higher price (Ph). The challenge for the monopolist is to choose the
combination of price and quantity that maximizes profits.

### Clear It Up {#clear-it-up .Heading3Grey}

#### What defines the market? {#what-defines-the-market .Heading4Grey}

A monopoly is a firm that sells all or nearly all of the goods and
services in a given market. However, what defines the "market"?

In a famous 1947 case, the federal government accused the DuPont company
of having a monopoly in the cellophane market, pointing out that DuPont
produced 75% of the cellophane in the United States. DuPont countered
that even though it had a 75% market share in cellophane, it had less
than a 20% share of the "flexible packaging materials," which includes
all other moisture-proof papers, films, and foils. In 1956, after years
of legal appeals, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the broader market
definition was more appropriate, and it dismissed the case against
DuPont.

Questions over how to define the market continue today. True, Microsoft
in the 1990s had a dominant share of the software for computer operating
systems, but in the total market for all computer software and services,
including everything from games to scientific programs, the Microsoft
share was only about 14% in 2014. The Greyhound bus company may have a
near-monopoly on the market for intercity bus transportation, but it is
only a small share of the market for intercity transportation if that
market includes private cars, airplanes, and railroad service. DeBeers
has a monopoly in diamonds, but it is a much smaller share of the total
market for precious gemstones and an even smaller share of the total
market for jewelry. A small town in the country may have only one gas
station: is this gas station a "monopoly," or does it compete with gas
stations that might be five, 10, or 50 miles away?

In general, if a firm produces a product without close substitutes, then
we can consider the firm a monopoly producer in a single market.
However, if buyers have a range of similar---even if not
identical---options available from other firms, then the firm is not a
monopoly. Still, arguments over whether substitutes are close or not
close can be controversial.

While a monopolist can charge *any* price for its product, nonetheless
the demand for the firm's product constrains the price. No monopolist,
even one that is thoroughly protected by high barriers to entry, can
require consumers to purchase its product. Because the monopolist is the
only firm in the market, its demand curve is the same as the market
demand curve, which is, unlike that for a perfectly competitive firm,
downward-sloping.

[Figure 9.3](#CNX_Econ_C09_008) illustrates this situation. The
monopolist can either choose a point like R with a low price (Pl) and
high quantity (Qh), or a point like S with a high price (Ph) and a low
quantity (Ql), or some intermediate point. Setting the price too high
will result in a low quantity sold, and will not bring in much revenue.
Conversely, setting the price too low may result in a high quantity
sold, but because of the low price, it will not bring in much revenue
either. The challenge for the monopolist is to strike a
profit-maximizing balance between the price it charges and the quantity
that it sells. However, why isn't the perfectly competitive firm's
demand curve also the market demand curve? See the following Clear It Up
feature for the answer to this question.

### Clear It Up {#clear-it-up-1 .Heading3Grey}

#### What is the difference between perceived demand and market demand? {#what-is-the-difference-between-perceived-demand-and-market-demand .Heading4Grey}

The demand curve as perceived by a perfectly competitive firm is not the
overall market demand curve for that product. However, the firm's demand
curve as perceived by a monopoly is the same as the market demand curve.
The reason for the difference is that each perfectly competitive firm
perceives the demand for its products in a market that includes many
other firms. In effect, the demand curve perceived by a perfectly
competitive firm is a tiny slice of the entire market demand curve. In
contrast, a monopoly perceives demand for its product in a market where
the monopoly is the only producer.

### Total Cost and Total Revenue for a Monopolist

We can illustrate profits for a monopolist with a graph of total
revenues and total costs, with the example of the hypothetical
HealthPill firm in [Figure 9.4](#CNX_Econ_C09_004). The total cost curve
has its typical shape that we learned about in [Production, Costs and
Industry
Structure](http://openstax.org/books/principles-microeconomics-3e/pages/7-introduction-to-production-costs-and-industry-structure),
and that we used in [Perfect
Competition](http://openstax.org/books/principles-microeconomics-3e/pages/8-introduction-to-perfect-competition);
that is, total costs rise and the curve grows steeper as output
increases, as the final column of [Table 9.2](#Table_09_02) shows.

![](media/9-2-how-a-profit-maximizing-monopoly-chooses-output-and-price_rId32.jpeg){width="4.88in" height="2.52in"}

Figure 9.4 Total Revenue and Total Cost for the HealthPill Monopoly
Total revenue for the monopoly firm called HealthPill first rises, then
falls. Low levels of output bring in relatively little total revenue,
because the quantity is low. High levels of output bring in relatively
less revenue, because the high quantity pushes down the market price.
The total cost curve is upward-sloping. Profits will be highest at the
quantity of output where total revenue is most above total cost. The
profit-maximizing level of output is not the same as the
revenue-maximizing level of output, which should make sense, because
profits take costs into account and revenues do not.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Table 9.2 Total Costs and Total Revenues of HealthPill

Total revenue, though, is different. Since a monopolist faces a downward
sloping demand curve, the only way it can sell more output is by
reducing its price. Selling more output raises revenue, but lowering
price reduces it. Thus, the shape of total revenue isn't clear. Let's
explore this using the data in [Table 9.2](#Table_09_02), which shows
quantities along the demand curve and the price at each quantity
demanded, and then calculates total revenue by multiplying price times
quantity at each level of output. (In this example, we give the output
as 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on, for the sake of simplicity. If you prefer a
dash of greater realism, you can imagine that the pharmaceutical company
measures these output levels and the corresponding prices per 1,000 or
10,000 pills.) As the figure illustrates, total revenue for a monopolist
has the shape of a hill, first rising, next flattening out, and then
falling. In this example, total revenue is highest at a quantity of 6 or
7.

However, the monopolist is not seeking to maximize revenue, but instead
to earn the highest possible profit. In the HealthPill example in
[Figure 9.4](#CNX_Econ_C09_004), the highest profit will occur at the
quantity where total revenue is the farthest above total cost. This
looks to be somewhere in the middle of the graph, but where exactly? It
is easier to see the profit maximizing level of output by using the
marginal approach, to which we turn next.

### Marginal Revenue and Marginal Cost for a Monopolist

In the real world, a monopolist often does not have enough information
to analyze its entire total revenues or total costs curves. After all,
the firm does not know exactly what would happen if it were to alter
production dramatically. However, a monopolist often has fairly reliable
information about how changing output by small or moderate amounts will
affect its marginal revenues and marginal costs, because it has had
experience with such changes over time and because modest changes are
easier to extrapolate from current experience. A monopolist can use
information on marginal revenue and marginal cost to seek out the
profit-maximizing combination of quantity and price.

[Table 9.3](#Table_09_03) expands [Table 9.2](#Table_09_02) using the
figures on total costs and total revenues from the HealthPill example to
calculate marginal revenue and marginal cost. This monopoly faces
typical upward-sloping marginal cost and downward-sloping marginal
revenue curves, as [Figure 9.5](#CNX_Econ_C09_005) shows.

Notice that marginal revenue is zero at a quantity of 7, and turns
negative at quantities higher than 7. It may seem counterintuitive that
marginal revenue could ever be zero or negative: after all, doesn\'t an
increase in quantity sold not always mean more revenue? For a perfect
competitor, each additional unit sold brought a positive marginal
revenue, because marginal revenue was equal to the given market price.
However, a monopolist can sell a larger quantity and see a decline in
total revenue. When a monopolist increases sales by one unit, it gains
some marginal revenue from selling that extra unit, but also loses some
marginal revenue because it must now sell every other unit at a lower
price. As the quantity sold becomes higher, at some point the drop in
price is proportionally more than the increase in greater quantity of
sales, causing a situation where more sales bring in less revenue. In
other words, marginal revenue is negative.

Figure 9.5 Marginal Revenue and Marginal Cost for the HealthPill
Monopoly For a monopoly like HealthPill, marginal revenue decreases as
it sells additional units of output. The marginal cost curve is
upward-sloping. The profit-maximizing choice for the monopoly will be to
produce at the quantity where marginal revenue is equal to marginal
cost: that is, MR = MC. If the monopoly produces a lower quantity, then
MR \> MC at those levels of output, and the firm can make higher profits
by expanding output. If the firm produces at a greater quantity, then MC
\> MR, and the firm can make higher profits by reducing its quantity of
output.

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Table 9.3 Costs and Revenues of HealthPill

A monopolist can determine its profit-maximizing price and quantity by
analyzing the marginal revenue and marginal costs of producing an extra
unit. If the marginal revenue exceeds the marginal cost, then the firm
should produce the extra unit.

For example, at an output of 4 in [Figure 9.5](#CNX_Econ_C09_005),
marginal revenue is 600 and marginal cost is 250, so producing this unit
will clearly add to overall profits. At an output of 5, marginal revenue
is 400 and marginal cost is 400, so producing this unit still means
overall profits are unchanged. However, expanding output from 5 to 6
would involve a marginal revenue of 200 and a marginal cost of 850, so
that sixth unit would actually reduce profits. Thus, the monopoly can
tell from the marginal revenue and marginal cost that of the choices in
the table, the profit-maximizing level of output is 5.

The monopoly could seek out the profit-maximizing level of output by
increasing quantity by a small amount, calculating marginal revenue and
marginal cost, and then either increasing output as long as marginal
revenue exceeds marginal cost or reducing output if marginal cost
exceeds marginal revenue. This process works without any need to
calculate total revenue and total cost. Thus, a profit-maximizing
monopoly should follow the rule of producing up to the quantity where
marginal revenue is equal to marginal cost---that is, MR = MC. This
quantity is easy to identify graphically, where MR and MC intersect.

### Work It Out {#work-it-out .Heading3Grey}

#### Maximizing Profits {#maximizing-profits .Heading4Grey}

If you find it counterintuitive that producing where marginal revenue
equals marginal cost will maximize profits, working through the numbers
will help.

Step 1. Remember, we define marginal cost as the change in total cost
from producing a small amount of additional output.

$\text{MC} = \frac{\text{change~in~total~cost}}{\text{change~in~quantity~produced}}$

Step 2. Note that in [Table 9.3](#Table_09_03), as output increases from
1 to 2 units, total cost increases from \$500 to \$775. As a result, the
marginal cost of the second unit will be:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{MC} & =\frac{\$ 775-\$ 500}{1} \\
& =\$ 275
\end{aligned}
$$

Step 3. Remember that, similarly, marginal revenue is the change in
total revenue from selling a small amount of additional output.

$$
\mathrm{MR}=\frac{\text { change in total revenue }}{\text { change in quantity sold }}
$$

Step 4. Note that in [Table 9.3](#Table_09_03), as output increases from
1 to 2 units, total revenue increases from \$1200 to \$2200. As a
result, the marginal revenue of the second unit will be:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{MR} & =\frac{\$ 2200-\$ 1200}{1} \\
& =\$ 1000
\end{aligned}
$$

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Table 9.4 Marginal Revenue, Marginal Cost, Marginal and Total Profit

[Table 9.4](#Table_09_04) repeats the marginal cost and marginal revenue
data from [Table 9.3](#Table_09_03), and adds two more columns: Marginal
profit is the profitability of each additional unit sold. We define it
as marginal revenue minus marginal cost. Finally, total profit is the
sum of marginal profits. As long as marginal profit is positive,
producing more output will increase total profits. When marginal profit
turns negative, producing more output will decrease total profits. Total
profit is maximized where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. In this
example, maximum profit occurs at 5 units of output.

A perfectly competitive firm will also find its profit-maximizing level
of output where MR = MC. The key difference with a perfectly competitive
firm is that in the case of perfect competition, marginal revenue is
equal to price (MR = P), while for a monopolist, marginal revenue is not
equal to the price, because changes in quantity of output affect the
price.

### Illustrating Monopoly Profits

It is straightforward to calculate profits of given numbers for total
revenue and total cost. However, the size of monopoly profits can also
be illustrated graphically with [Figure 9.6](#CNX_Econ_C09_006), which
takes the marginal cost and marginal revenue curves from the previous
exhibit and adds an average cost curve and the monopolist's perceived
demand curve. [Table 9.5](#eip-806) shows the data for these curves.

Table 9.5

![](media/9-2-how-a-profit-maximizing-monopoly-chooses-output-and-price_rId55.jpeg){width="4.88in" height="3.02in"}

Figure 9.6 Illustrating Profits at the HealthPill Monopoly This figure
begins with the same marginal revenue and marginal cost curves from the
HealthPill monopoly from [Figure 9.5](#CNX_Econ_C09_005). It then adds
an average cost curve and the demand curve that the monopolist faces.
The HealthPill firm first chooses the quantity where MR = MC. In this
example, the quantity is 5. The monopolist then decides what price to
charge by looking at the demand curve it faces. The large box, with
quantity on the horizontal axis and demand (which shows the price) on
the vertical axis, shows total revenue for the firm. The lighter-shaded
box, which is quantity on the horizontal axis and average cost of
production on the vertical axis shows the firm\'s total costs. The large
total revenue box minus the smaller total cost box leaves the darkly
shaded box that shows total profits. Since the price charged is above
average cost, the firm is earning positive profits.

[Figure 9.7](#CNX_Econ_C09_007) illustrates the three-step process where
a monopolist: selects the profit-maximizing quantity to produce; decides
what price to charge; determines total revenue, total cost, and profit.

**Step 1: The Monopolist Determines Its Profit-Maximizing Level of
Output**

The firm can use the points on the demand curve D to calculate total
revenue, and then, based on total revenue, calculate its marginal
revenue curve. The profit-maximizing quantity will occur where MR =
MC---or at the last possible point before marginal costs start exceeding
marginal revenue. On [Figure 9.6](#CNX_Econ_C09_006), MR = MC occurs at
an output of 5.

**Step 2: The Monopolist Decides What Price to Charge**

The monopolist will charge what the market is willing to pay. A dotted
line drawn straight up from the profit-maximizing quantity to the demand
curve shows the profit-maximizing price which, in [Figure
9.6](#CNX_Econ_C09_006), is \$800. This price is above the average cost
curve, which shows that the firm is earning profits.

**Step 3: Calculate Total Revenue, Total Cost, and Profit**

Total revenue is the overall shaded box, where the width of the box is
the quantity sold and the height is the price. In [Figure
9.6](#CNX_Econ_C09_006), this is 5 x \$800 = \$4000. In [Figure
9.6](#CNX_Econ_C09_006), the bottom part of the shaded box, which is
shaded more lightly, shows total costs; that is, quantity on the
horizontal axis multiplied by average cost on the vertical axis or 5 x
\$330 = \$1650. The larger box of total revenues minus the smaller box
of total costs will equal profits, which the darkly shaded box shows.
Using the numbers gives \$4000 - \$1650 = \$2350. In a perfectly
competitive market, the forces of entry would erode this profit in the
long run. However, a monopolist is protected by barriers to entry. In
fact, one obvious sign of a possible monopoly is when a firm earns
profits year after year, while doing more or less the same thing,
without ever seeing increased competition eroding those profits.

Figure 9.7 How a Profit-Maximizing Monopoly Decides Price In Step 1, the
monopoly chooses the profit-maximizing level of output Q~1~, by choosing
the quantity where MR = MC. In Step 2, the monopoly decides how much to
charge for output level Q~1~ by drawing a line straight up from Q~1~ to
point R on its perceived demand curve. Thus, the monopoly will charge a
price (P~1~). In Step 3, the monopoly identifies its profit. Total
revenue will be Q~1~ multiplied by P~1~. Total cost will be Q~1~
multiplied by the average cost of producing Q~1~, which point S shows on
the average cost curve to be P~2~. Profits will be the total revenue
rectangle minus the total cost rectangle, which the shaded zone in the
figure shows.

### Clear It Up {#clear-it-up-2 .Heading3Grey}

#### Why is a monopolist's marginal revenue always less than the price? {#why-is-a-monopolists-marginal-revenue-always-less-than-the-price .Heading4Grey}

The marginal revenue curve for a monopolist always lies beneath the
market demand curve. To understand why, think about increasing the
quantity along the demand curve by one unit, so that you take one step
down the demand curve to a slightly higher quantity but a slightly lower
price. A demand curve is not sequential: It is not that first we sell
Q~1~ at a higher price, and then we sell Q~2~ at a lower price. Rather,
a demand curve is conditional: If we charge the higher price, we would
sell Q~1~. If, instead, we charge a lower price (on all the units that
we sell), we would sell Q~2~.

When we think about increasing the quantity sold by one unit, marginal
revenue is affected in two ways. First, we sell one additional unit at
the new market price. Second, all the previous units, which we sold at
the higher price, now sell for less. Because of the lower price on all
units sold, the marginal revenue of selling a unit is less than the
price of that unit---and the marginal revenue curve is below the demand
curve. *Tip*: For a straight-line demand curve, MR and demand have the
same vertical intercept. As output increases, marginal revenue decreases
twice as fast as demand, so that the horizontal intercept of MR is
halfway to the horizontal intercept of demand. You can see this in the
[Figure 9.8](#CNX_Econ_C09_009).

Because the market demand curve is conditional, the marginal revenue
curve for a monopolist lies beneath the demand curve.

### The Inefficiency of Monopoly

Most people criticize monopolies because they charge too high a price,
but what economists object to is that monopolies do not supply enough
output to be allocatively efficient. To understand why a monopoly is
inefficient, it is useful to compare it with the benchmark model of
perfect competition.

Allocative efficiency is an economic concept regarding efficiency at the
social or societal level. It refers to producing the optimal quantity of
some output, the quantity where the marginal benefit to society of one
more unit just equals the marginal cost. The rule of profit maximization
in a world of perfect competition was for each firm to produce the
quantity of output where P = MC, where the price (P) is a measure of how
much buyers value the good and the marginal cost (MC) is a measure of
what marginal units cost society to produce. Following this rule assures
allocative efficiency. If P \> MC, then the marginal benefit to society
(as measured by P) is greater than the marginal cost to society of
producing additional units, and a greater quantity should be produced.
However, in the case of monopoly, price is always greater than marginal
cost at the profit-maximizing level of output, as you can see by looking
back at [Figure 9.6](#CNX_Econ_C09_006). Thus, consumers do not benefit
from a monopoly because it will sell a lower quantity in the market, at
a higher price, than would have been the case in a perfectly competitive
market.

The problem of inefficiency for monopolies often runs even deeper than
these issues, and also involves incentives for efficiency over longer
periods of time. There are counterbalancing incentives here. On one
side, firms may strive for new inventions and new intellectual property
because they want to become monopolies and earn high profits---at least
for a few years until the competition catches up. In this way,
monopolies may come to exist because of competitive pressures on firms.
However, once a barrier to entry is in place, a monopoly that does not
need to fear competition can just produce the same old products in the
same old way---while still ringing up a healthy rate of profit. John
Hicks, who won the Nobel Prize for economics in 1972, wrote in 1935:
"The best of all monopoly profits is a quiet life." He did not mean the
comment in a complimentary way. He meant that monopolies may bank their
profits and slack off on trying to please their customers.

When AT&T provided all of the local and long-distance phone service in
the United States, along with manufacturing most of the phone equipment,
the payment plans and types of phones did not change much. The old joke
was that you could have any color phone you wanted, as long as it was
black. However, in 1982, government litigation split up AT&T into a
number of local phone companies, a long-distance phone company, and a
phone equipment manufacturer. An explosion of innovation followed.
Services like call waiting, caller ID, three-way calling, voice mail
through the phone company, mobile phones, and wireless connections to
the internet all became available. Companies offered a wide range of
payment plans, as well. It was no longer true that all phones were
black. Instead, phones came in a wide variety of shapes and colors. The
end of the telephone monopoly brought lower prices, a greater quantity
of services, and also a wave of innovation aimed at attracting and
pleasing customers.

### Bring It Home {#bring-it-home .Heading3Grey}

#### The Rest is History {#the-rest-is-history .Heading4Grey}

In the opening case, we presented the East India Company and the
Confederate States as a monopoly or near monopoly provider of a good.
Nearly every American schoolchild knows the result of the "unwelcome
visit" the "Mohawks" bestowed upon Boston Harbor's tea-bearing
ships---the Boston Tea Party. Regarding the cotton industry, we also
know Great Britain remained neutral during the Civil War, taking neither
side during the conflict.

Did the monopoly nature of these business have unintended and historical
consequences? Might the American Revolution have been deterred, if the
East India Company had sailed the tea-bearing ships back to England?
Might the southern states have made different decisions had they not
been so confident "King Cotton" would force diplomatic recognition of
the Confederate States of America? Of course, it is not possible to
definitively answer these questions. We cannot roll back the clock and
try a different scenario. We can, however, consider the monopoly nature
of these businesses and the roles they played and hypothesize about what
might have occurred under different circumstances.

Perhaps if there had been legal free tea trade, the colonists would have
seen things differently. There was smuggled Dutch tea in the colonial
market. If the colonists had been able to freely purchase Dutch tea,
they would have paid lower prices and avoided the tax.

What about the cotton monopoly? With one in five jobs in Great Britain
depending on Southern cotton and the Confederate States as nearly the
sole provider of that cotton, why did Great Britain remain neutral
during the Civil War? At the beginning of the war, Britain simply drew
down massive stores of cotton. These stockpiles lasted until near the
end of 1862. Why did Britain not recognize the Confederacy at that
point? Two reasons: The Emancipation Proclamation and new sources of
cotton. Having outlawed slavery throughout the United Kingdom in 1833,
it was politically impossible for Great Britain, empty cotton warehouses
or not, to recognize, diplomatically, the Confederate States. In
addition, during the two years it took to draw down the stockpiles,
Britain expanded cotton imports from India, Egypt, and Brazil.

Monopoly sellers often see no threats to their superior marketplace
position. In these examples did the power of the monopoly hide other
possibilities from the decision makers? Perhaps. As a result of their
actions, this is how history unfolded.
