### Introduction to Monopoly and Antitrust Policy

#### Bring It Home {#bring-it-home .Heading3Grey}

##### More than Cooking, Heating, and Cooling {#more-than-cooking-heating-and-cooling .Heading4Grey}

If you live in the United States, there is a slightly better than 50--50
chance your home is heated and cooled using natural gas. You may even
use natural gas for cooking. However, those uses are not the primary
uses of natural gas in the U.S. In late 2021, according to the U.S.
Energy Information Administration, home heating, cooling, and cooking
accounted for nearly 20% of natural gas usage. What accounts for the
rest? The greatest uses for natural gas are the generation of electric
power (almost 37%) and in industry (30%). Together these three uses for
natural gas touch many areas of our lives, so why would there be any
opposition to a merger of two natural gas firms? After all, a merger
could mean increased efficiencies and reduced costs to people like you
and me.

In October 2011, Kinder Morgan and El Paso Corporation, two natural gas
firms, announced they were merging. The announcement stated the combined
firm would link "nearly every major production region with markets," cut
costs by "eliminating duplication in pipelines and other assets," and
that "the savings could be passed on to consumers."

The objection? The \$21.1 billion deal would give Kinder Morgan control
of more than 80,000 miles of pipeline, making the new firm the third
largest energy producer in North America. Policymakers and the public
wondered whether the new conglomerate really would pass on cost savings
to consumers, or would the merger give Kinder Morgan a strong oligopoly
position in the natural gas marketplace?

That brings us to the central questions this chapter poses: What should
the balance be between corporate size and a larger number of competitors
in a marketplace, and what role should the government play in this
balancing act?

The previous chapters on the theory of the firm identified three
important lessons: First, that competition, by providing consumers with
lower prices and a variety of innovative products, is a good thing;
second, that large-scale production can dramatically lower average
costs; and third, that markets in the real world are rarely perfectly
competitive. As a consequence, government policymakers must determine
how much to intervene to balance the potential benefits of large-scale
production against the potential loss of competition that can occur when
businesses grow in size, especially through mergers.

For example, in 2006, AT&T and BellSouth proposed a merger. At the time,
there were very few mobile phone service providers. Both the Justice
Department and the FCC blocked the proposal.

The two companies argued that the merger would benefit consumers, who
would be able to purchase better telecommunications services at a
cheaper price because the newly created firm would take advantage of
economies of scale and eliminate duplicate investments. However, a
number of activist groups like the Consumer Federation of America and
Public Knowledge expressed fears that the merger would reduce
competition and lead to higher prices for consumers for decades to come.
In December 2006, the federal government allowed the merger to proceed.
By 2009, the new post-merger AT&T was the eighth largest company by
revenues in the United States, and by that measure the largest
telecommunications company in the world. Economists have spent -- and
will still spend -- years trying to determine whether the merger of AT&T
and BellSouth, as well as other smaller mergers of telecommunications
companies at about this same time, helped consumers, hurt them, or did
not make much difference.

This chapter discusses public policy issues about competition. How can
economists and governments determine when mergers of large companies
like AT&T and BellSouth should be allowed and when they should be
blocked? The government also plays a role in policing anticompetitive
behavior other than mergers, like prohibiting certain kinds of contracts
that might restrict competition. In the case of natural monopoly,
however, trying to preserve competition probably will not work very
well, and so government will often resort to regulation of price and/or
quantity of output. In recent decades, there has been a global trend
toward less government intervention in the price and output decisions of
businesses.


### 11.1 Corporate Mergers

#### Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

-   Explain antitrust law and its significance
-   Calculate concentration ratios
-   Calculate the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI)
-   Evaluate methods of antitrust regulation

A corporate merger occurs when two formerly separate firms combine to
become a single firm. When one firm purchases another, it is called an
acquisition. An acquisition may not look just like a merger, since the
newly purchased firm may continue to operate under its former company
name. Mergers can also be lateral, where two firms of similar sizes
combine to become one. However, both mergers and acquisitions lead to
two formerly separate firms operating under common ownership, and so
they are commonly grouped together.

#### Regulations for Approving Mergers

Since a merger combines two firms into one, it can reduce the extent of
competition between firms. Therefore, when two U.S. firms announce a
merger or acquisition where at least one of the firms is above a minimum
size of sales (a threshold that moves up gradually over time, and was at
\$101 million in 2022), or certain other conditions are met, they are
required under law to notify the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC).
The left-hand panel of [Figure 11.2](#CNX_Econ_C11_004) (a) shows the
number of mergers submitted for review to the FTC each year from 1999 to
2012. Mergers follow the business cycle, falling after the 2001
recession, peaking in 2007 as the Great Recession struck, and then
rising since 2009. The right-hand panel of [Figure
11.2](#CNX_Econ_C11_004) (b) shows the distribution of those mergers
submitted for review in 2015 as measured by the size of the transaction.
It is important to remember that this total leaves out many small
mergers under \$50 million, which companies only need to report in
certain limited circumstances. In 2012, 26 percent of all reported
merger and acquisition transactions exceeded \$500 million, while 11
percent exceeded \$1 billion.

![](media/11-1-corporate-mergers_rId24.jpeg){width="6.5in" height="2.827823709536308in"}

Figure 11.2 Number and Size of Mergers (a) The number of mergers grew
from 2003 to 2007, then fell dramatically during the 2008-2009 Great
Recession, before recovering since. (b) In 2012, the greatest number of
mergers submitted for review by the Federal Trade Commission was for
transactions between \$100--\$150 million.

The laws that give government the power to block certain mergers, and
even in some cases to break up large firms into smaller ones, are called
antitrust laws. Before a large merger happens, the antitrust regulators
at the FTC and the U.S. Department of Justice can allow the merger,
prohibit it, or allow it if certain conditions are met. One common
condition is that the merger will be allowed if the firm agrees to sell
off certain parts. For example, in 2006, Johnson & Johnson bought the
Pfizer's "consumer health" division, which included well-known brands
like Listerine mouthwash and Sudafed cold medicine. As a condition of
allowing the merger, Johnson & Johnson was required to sell off six
brands to other firms, including ZantacÂ® heartburn relief medication,
Cortizone anti-itch cream, and Balmex diaper rash medication, to
preserve a greater degree of competition in these markets.

The U.S. government approves most proposed mergers. In a market-oriented
economy, firms have the freedom to make their own choices. Private firms
generally have the freedom to:

-   expand or reduce production
-   set the price they choose
-   open new factories or sales facilities or close them
-   hire workers or to lay them off
-   start selling new products or stop selling existing ones

If the owners want to acquire a firm or be acquired, or to merge with
another firm, this decision is just one of many that firms are free to
make. In these conditions, the managers of private firms will sometimes
make mistakes. They may close down a factory which, it later turns out,
would have been profitable. They may start selling a product that ends
up losing money. A merger between two companies can sometimes lead to a
clash of corporate personalities that makes both firms worse off.
However, the fundamental belief behind a market-oriented economy is that
firms, not governments, are in the best position to know if their
actions will lead to attracting more customers or producing more
efficiently.

Government regulators agree that most mergers are beneficial to
consumers. As the Federal Trade Commission has noted on its website (as
of November, 2013): "Most mergers actually benefit competition and
consumers by allowing firms to operate more efficiently." At the same
time, the FTC recognizes, "Some \[mergers\] are likely to lessen
competition. That, in turn, can lead to higher prices, reduced
availability of goods or services, lower quality of products, and less
innovation. Some mergers create a concentrated market, while others
enable a single firm to raise prices." The challenge for the antitrust
regulators at the FTC and the U.S. Department of Justice is to figure
out when a merger may hinder competition. This decision involves both
numerical tools and some judgments that are difficult to quantify. The
following Clear It Up explains the origins of U.S. antitrust law.

#### Clear It Up {#clear-it-up .Heading3Grey}

##### What is U.S. antitrust law? {#what-is-u.s.-antitrust-law .Heading4Grey}

In the closing decades of the 1800s, many industries in the U.S. economy
were dominated by a single firm that had most of the sales for the
entire country. Supporters of these large firms argued that they could
take advantage of economies of scale and careful planning to provide
consumers with products at low prices. However, critics pointed out that
when competition was reduced, these firms were free to charge more and
make permanently higher profits, and that without the goading of
competition, it was not clear that they were as efficient or innovative
as they could be.

In many cases, these large firms were organized in the legal form of a
"trust," in which a group of formerly independent firms were
consolidated by mergers and purchases, and a group of "trustees" then
ran the companies as if they were a single firm. Thus, when the U.S.
government sought to limit the power of these trusts, it passed the
Sherman Antitrust Act in 1890 - the nation\'s first antitrust law. In an
early demonstration of the law's power, the U.S. Supreme Court in 1911
upheld the government's right to break up Standard Oil, which had
controlled about 90% of the country's oil refining, into 34 independent
firms, including Exxon, Mobil, Amoco, and Chevron. In 1914, the Clayton
Antitrust Act outlawed mergers and acquisitions (where the outcome would
be to "substantially lessen competition" in an industry), price
discrimination (where different customers are charged different prices
for the same product), and tied sales (where purchase of one product
commits the buyer to purchase some other product). Also in 1914, the
Federal Trade Commission (FTC) was created to define more specifically
what competition was unfair. In 1950, the Celler-Kefauver Act extended
the Clayton Act by restricting vertical and conglomerate mergers. A
vertical merger occurs when two or more firms, operating at different
levels within an industry\'s supply chain, merge operations. A
conglomerate merger is a merger between firms that are involved in
totally unrelated business activities. In the twenty-first century, the
FTC and the U.S. Department of Justice continue to enforce antitrust
laws.

#### The Four-Firm Concentration Ratio

Regulators have struggled for decades to measure the degree of monopoly
power in an industry. An early tool was the concentration ratio, which
measures the combined market share (or percent of total industry sales)
which is accounted for by the largest firms (typically the top four to
eight). For an explanation of how high market concentrations can create
inefficiencies in an economy, refer to
[Monopoly](http://openstax.org/books/principles-microeconomics-3e/pages/9-introduction-to-a-monopoly).

Say that the market for replacing broken automobile windshields in a
certain city has 18 firms with the market shares in [Table
11.1](#Table_11_01), where the market share is each firm's proportion of
total sales in that market. We calculate the four-firm concentration
ratio by adding the market shares of the four largest firms: in this
case, 16 + 10 + 8 + 6 = 40. We do not consider this concentration ratio
especially high, because the largest four firms have less than half the
market.

Table 11.1 Calculating Concentration Ratios from Market Shares

The concentration ratio approach can help to clarify some of the
fuzziness over deciding when a merger might affect competition. For
instance, if two of the smallest firms in the hypothetical market for
repairing automobile windshields merged, the four-firm concentration
ratio would not change---which implies that there is not much worry that
the degree of competition in the market has notably diminished. However,
if the top two firms merged, then the four-firm concentration ratio
would become 46 (that is, 26 + 8 + 6 + 6). While this concentration
ratio is modestly higher, the four-firm concentration ratio would still
be less than half, so such a proposed merger might barely raise an
eyebrow among antitrust regulators.

#### The Herfindahl-Hirschman Index

A four-firm concentration ratio is a simple tool, which may reveal only
part of the story. For example, consider two industries that both have a
four-firm concentration ratio of 80. However, in one industry five firms
each control 20% of the market, while in the other industry, the top
firm holds 77% of the market and all the other firms have 1% each.
Although the four-firm concentration ratios are identical, it would be
reasonable to worry more about the extent of competition in the second
case---where the largest firm is nearly a monopoly---than in the first.

Another approach to measuring industry concentration that can
distinguish between these two cases is called the Herfindahl-Hirschman
Index (HHI). We calculate HHI by summing the squares of the market share
of each firm in the industry, as the following Work It Out shows.

#### Work It Out {#work-it-out .Heading3Grey}

##### Calculating HHI {#calculating-hhi .Heading4Grey}

Step 1. Calculate the HHI for a monopoly with a market share of 100%.
Because there is only one firm, it has 100% market share. The HHI is
100^2^ = 10,000.

Step 2. For an extremely competitive industry, with dozens or hundreds
of extremely small competitors, the HHI value might drop as low as 100
or even less. Calculate the HHI for an industry with 100 firms that each
have 1% of the market. In this case, the HHI is 100(1^2^) = 100.

Step 3. Calculate the HHI for the industry in [Table
11.1](#Table_11_01). In this case, the HHI is 16^2^ + 10^2^ + 8^2^ +
7(6^2^) + 8(3^2^) = 744.

Step 4. Note that the HHI gives greater weight to large firms.

Step 5. Consider the earlier example, comparing one industry where five
firms each have 20% of the market with an industry where one firm has
77% and the other 23 firms have 1% each. The two industries have the
same four-firm concentration ratio of 80. However, the HHI for the first
industry is 5(20^2^) = 2,000, while the HHI for the second industry is
much higher at 77^2^ + 23(1^2^) = 5,952.

Step 6. Note that the near-monopolist in the second industry drives up
the HHI measure of industrial concentration.

Step 7. Review [Table 11.2](#Table_11_02) which gives some examples of
the four-firm concentration ratio and the HHI in various U.S. industries
in 2016. (You can find market share data from multiple industry sources.
Data in the table are from: Statista.com (for wireless), *The Wall
Street Journal* (for automobiles), Gartner.com (for computers) and the
U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics (for airlines).)

Table 11.2 Examples of Concentration Ratios and HHIs in the U.S.
Economy, 2016

In the 1980s, the FTC followed these guidelines: If a merger would
result in an HHI of less than 1,000, the FTC would probably approve it.
If a merger would result in an HHI of more than 1,800, the FTC would
probably challenge it. If a merger would result in an HHI between 1,000
and 1,800, then the FTC would scrutinize the plan and make a
case-by-case decision. However, in the last several decades, the
antitrust enforcement authorities have moved away from relying as
heavily on measures of concentration ratios and HHIs to determine
whether they will allow a merger, and instead they carry out more
case-by-case analysis on the extent of competition in different
industries.

#### New Directions for Antitrust

Both the four-firm concentration ratio and the Herfindahl-Hirschman
index share some weaknesses. First, they begin from the assumption that
the "market" under discussion is well-defined, and the only question is
measuring how sales are divided in that market. Second, they are based
on an implicit assumption that competitive conditions across industries
are similar enough that a broad measure of concentration in the market
is enough to make a decision about the effects of a merger. These
assumptions, however, are not always correct. In response to these two
problems, the antitrust regulators have been changing their approach in
the last decade or two.

Defining a market is often controversial. For example, Microsoft in the
early 2000s had a dominant share of the software for computer operating
systems. However, in the total market for all computer software and
services, including everything from games to scientific programs, the
Microsoft share was only about 14% in 2014. A narrowly defined market
will tend to make concentration appear higher, while a broadly defined
market will tend to make it appear smaller.

In recent decades, there have been two especially important shifts
affecting how we define markets: one centers on technology and the other
centers on globalization. In addition, these two shifts are
interconnected. With the vast improvement in communications
technologies, including the development of the internet, a consumer can
order books or pet supplies from all over the country or the world. As a
result, the degree of competition many local retail businesses face has
increased. The same effect may operate even more strongly in markets for
business supplies, where so-called "business-to-business" websites can
allow buyers and suppliers from anywhere in the world to find each
other.

Globalization has changed the market boundaries. As recently as the
1970s, it was common for measurements of concentration ratios and HHIs
to stop at national borders. Now, many industries find that their
competition comes from the global market. A few decades ago, three
companies, General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler, dominated the U.S. auto
market. By 2014, however, production of these three firms accounted for
less than half of U.S. auto sales, although by 2021, with the emergence
of COVID-19, the three firms accounted for essentially half of U.S. auto
sales. The three firms face competition from well-known car
manufacturers such as Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Volkswagen, Mitsubishi, and
Mazda. When analysts calculate HHIs with a global perspective,
concentration in most major industries---including cars---is lower than
in a purely domestic context.

Because attempting to define a particular market can be difficult and
controversial, the Federal Trade Commission has begun to look less at
market share and more at the data on actual competition between
businesses. For example, in February 2007, Whole Foods Market and Wild
Oats Market announced that they wished to merge. These were the two
largest companies in the market that the government defined as "premium
natural and organic supermarket chains." However, one could also argue
that they were two relatively small companies in the broader market for
all stores that sell groceries or specialty food products.

Rather than relying on a market definition, the government antitrust
regulators looked at detailed evidence on profits and prices for
specific stores in different cities, both before and after other
competitive stores entered or exited. Based on that evidence, the
Federal Trade Commission decided to block the merger. After two years of
legal battles, the FTC eventually allowed the merger in 2009 under the
conditions that Whole Foods sell off the Wild Oats brand name and a
number of individual stores, to preserve competition in certain local
markets. For more on the difficulties of defining markets, refer to
[Monopoly](http://openstax.org/books/principles-microeconomics-3e/pages/9-introduction-to-a-monopoly).

This new approach to antitrust regulation involves detailed analysis of
specific markets and companies, instead of defining a market and
counting up total sales. A common starting point is for antitrust
regulators to use statistical tools and real-world evidence to estimate
the demand curves and supply curves the firms proposing a merger face. A
second step is to specify how competition occurs in this specific
industry. Some possibilities include competing to cut prices, to raise
output, to build a brand name through advertising, and to build a
reputation for good service or high quality. With these pieces of the
puzzle in place, it is then possible to build a statistical model that
estimates the likely outcome for consumers if the two firms are allowed
to merge. These models do require some degree of subjective judgment,
and so they can become the subject of legal disputes between the
antitrust authorities and the companies that wish to merge.


### 11.2 Regulating Anticompetitive Behavior

#### Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

-   Analyze restrictive practices
-   Explain tying sales, bundling, and predatory pricing
-   Evaluate a real-world situation of possible anticompetitive and
    restrictive practices

The U.S. antitrust laws reach beyond blocking mergers that would reduce
competition to include a wide array of anticompetitive practices. For
example, it is illegal for competitors to form a cartel to collude to
make pricing and output decisions, as if they were a monopoly firm. The
Federal Trade Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice prohibit
firms from agreeing to fix prices or output, rigging bids, or sharing or
dividing markets by allocating customers, suppliers, territories, or
lines of commerce.

In the late 1990s, for example, the antitrust regulators prosecuted an
international cartel of vitamin manufacturers, including the Swiss firm
Hoffman-La Roche, the German firm BASF, and the French firm
Rhone-Poulenc. These firms reached agreements on how much to produce,
how much to charge, and which firm would sell to which customers. Firms
like General Mills, Kellogg, Purina Mills, and Proctor and Gamble bought
the high-priced vitamins, which pushed up the prices more. Hoffman-La
Roche pleaded guilty in May 1999 and agreed both to pay a fine of \$500
million and to have at least one top executive be incarcerated for four
months.

Under U.S. antitrust laws, monopoly itself is not illegal. If a firm has
a monopoly because of a newly patented invention, for example, the law
explicitly allows a firm to earn higher-than-normal profits for a time
as a reward for innovation. If a firm achieves a large share of the
market by producing a better product at a lower price, such behavior is
not prohibited by antitrust law.

#### Restrictive Practices

Antitrust law includes rules against restrictive practices---practices
that do not involve outright agreements to raise price or to reduce the
quantity produced, but that might have the effect of reducing
competition. Antitrust cases involving restrictive practices are often
controversial, because they delve into specific contracts or agreements
between firms that are allowed in some cases but not in others.

For example, an exclusive dealing agreement between a manufacturer and a
dealer can be legal or illegal. It is legal if the purpose of the
contract is to encourage competition between dealers. For example, it is
legal for the Ford Motor Company to sell its cars to only Ford dealers,
and for General Motors to sell to only GM dealers, and so on. However,
exclusive deals may also limit competition. If one large retailer
obtained the exclusive rights to be the sole distributor of televisions,
computers, and audio equipment made by a number of companies, then this
exclusive contract would have an anticompetitive effect on other
retailers.

Tying sales happen when a customer is allowed to buy one product only if
the customer also buys a second product. Tying sales are controversial
because they force consumers to purchase a product that they may not
actually want or need. Further, the additional, required products are
not necessarily advantageous to the customer. Suppose that to purchase a
popular DVD, the store required that you also purchase a certain
portable TV model. These products are only loosely related, thus there
is no reason to make the purchase of one contingent on the other. Even
if a customer were interested in a portable TV, the tying to a
particular model prevents the customer from having the option of
selecting one from the numerous types available in the market.

A related, but not identical, concept is bundling, where a firm sells
two or more products as one. Bundling typically offers an advantage for
consumers by allowing them to acquire multiple products or services for
a better price. For example, several cable companies allow customers to
buy products like cable, internet, and a phone line through a special
price available through bundling. Customers are also welcome to purchase
these products separately, but the price of bundling is usually more
appealing.

In some cases, we can view tying sales and bundling as anticompetitive.
However, in other cases they may be legal and even common. It is common
for people to purchase season tickets to a sports team or a set of
concerts so as to guarantee tickets to the few contests or shows that
are most popular and likely to sell out. Computer software manufacturers
may often bundle a number of different programs, even when the buyer
wants only a few. Think about the software that is included in a new
computer purchase, for example.

Recall from the chapter on
[Monopoly](http://openstax.org/books/principles-microeconomics-3e/pages/9-introduction-to-a-monopoly)
that predatory pricing occurs when the existing firm (or firms) reacts
to a new firm by dropping prices very low, until the new firm is driven
out of the market, at which point the existing firm raises prices again.
This pattern of pricing is aimed at deterring new firms from entering
the market. However, in practice, it can be hard to figure out when
pricing is predatory. Say that American Airlines is flying between two
cities, and a new airline starts flying between the same two cities, at
a lower price. If American Airlines cuts its price to match the new
entrant, is this predatory pricing or is it just market competition at
work? A commonly proposed rule is that if a firm is selling for less
than its average variable cost---that is, at a price where it should be
shutting down---then there is evidence for predatory pricing. However,
calculating in the real world what costs are variable and what costs are
fixed is often not obvious, either.

The Microsoft antitrust case embodies many of these gray areas in
restrictive practices, as the next Clear It Up shows.

#### Clear It Up {#clear-it-up .Heading3Grey}

##### Did Microsoft^Â®^ engage in anticompetitive and restrictive practices? {#did-microsoft-engage-in-anticompetitive-and-restrictive-practices .Heading4Grey}

The most famous restrictive practices case of recent years was a series
of lawsuits by the U.S. government against Microsoft---lawsuits that
some of Microsoft's competitors encouraged. All sides admitted that
Microsoft's Windows program had a near-monopoly position in the market
for the software used in general computer operating systems. All sides
agreed that the software had many satisfied customers and that the
computer software capabilities were compatible with Windows. Software
that Microsoft and other companies produced had expanded dramatically in
the 1990s. Having a monopoly or a near-monopoly is not necessarily
illegal in and of itself, but in cases where one company controls a
great deal of the market, antitrust regulators look at any allegations
of restrictive practices with special care.

The antitrust regulators argued that Microsoft had gone beyond profiting
from its software innovations and its dominant position in the software
market for operating systems, and had tried to use its market power in
operating systems software to take over other parts of the software
industry. For example, the government argued that Microsoft had engaged
in an anticompetitive form of exclusive dealing by threatening computer
makers that, if they did not leave another firm's software off their
machines (specifically, Netscape's Internet browser), then Microsoft
would not sell them its operating system software. Government antitrust
regulators accused Microsoft of tying together its Windows operating
system software, where it had a monopoly, with its Internet Explorer
browser software, where it did not have a monopoly, and thus using this
bundling as an anticompetitive tool. The government also accused
Microsoft of a form of predatory pricing; namely, giving away certain
additional software products for free as part of Windows, as a way of
driving out the competition from other software makers.

In April 2000, a federal court held that Microsoft's behavior had
crossed the line into unfair competition, and recommended that the
company be split into two competing firms. However, the court overturned
that penalty on appeal, and in November 2002 Microsoft reached a
settlement with the government that it would end its restrictive
practices.

The concept of restrictive practices is continually evolving, as firms
seek new ways to earn profits and government regulators define what is
permissible. A situation where the law is evolving and changing is
always somewhat troublesome, since laws are most useful and fair when
firms know what they are in advance. In addition, since the law is open
to interpretation, competitors who are losing out in the market can
accuse successful firms of anticompetitive restrictive practices, and
try to win through government regulation what they have failed to
accomplish in the market. Officials at the Federal Trade Commission and
the Department of Justice are, of course, aware of these issues, but
there is no easy way to resolve them.


### 11.3 Regulating Natural Monopolies

#### Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

-   Evaluate the appropriate competition policy for a natural monopoly
-   Interpret a graph of regulatory choices
-   Contrast cost-plus and price cap regulation

Most true monopolies today in the U.S. are regulated, natural
monopolies. A natural monopoly poses a difficult challenge for
competition policy, because the structure of costs and demand makes
competition unlikely or costly. A natural monopoly arises when average
costs are declining over the range of production that satisfies market
demand. This typically happens when fixed costs are large relative to
variable costs. As a result, one firm is able to supply the total
quantity demanded in the market at lower cost than two or more
firms---so splitting up the natural monopoly would raise the average
cost of production and force customers to pay more.

Public utilities, the companies that have traditionally provided water
and electrical service across much of the United States, are leading
examples of natural monopoly. It would make little sense to argue that a
local water company should be divided into several competing companies,
each with its own separate set of pipes and water supplies. Installing
four or five identical sets of pipes under a city, one for each water
company, so that each household could choose its own water provider,
would be terribly costly. The same argument applies to the idea of
having many competing companies for delivering electricity to homes,
each with its own set of wires. Before the advent of wireless phones,
the argument also applied to the idea of many different phone companies,
each with its own set of phone wires running through the neighborhood.

#### The Choices in Regulating a Natural Monopoly

What then is the appropriate competition policy for a natural monopoly?
[Figure 11.3](#CNX_Econ_C11_003) illustrates the case of natural
monopoly, with a market demand curve that cuts through the
downward-sloping portion of the average cost curve. Points A, B, C, and
F illustrate four of the main choices for regulation. [Table
11.3](#Table_11_05) outlines the regulatory choices for dealing with a
natural monopoly.

Figure 11.3 Regulatory Choices in Dealing with Natural Monopoly A
natural monopoly will maximize profits by producing at the quantity
where marginal revenue (MR) equals marginal costs (MC) and by then
looking to the market demand curve to see what price to charge for this
quantity. This monopoly will produce at point A, with a quantity of 4
and a price of 9.3. If antitrust regulators split this company exactly
in half, then each half would produce at point B, with average costs of
9.75 and output of 2. The regulators might require the firm to produce
where marginal cost crosses the market demand curve at point C. However,
if the firm is required to produce at a quantity of 8 and sell at a
price of 3.5, the firm will incur losses. The most likely choice is
point F, where the firm is required to produce a quantity of 6 and
charge a price of 6.5.

Table 11.3 Regulatory Choices in Dealing with Natural Monopoly (\*We
obtain total revenue by multiplying price and quantity. However, we have
rounded some of the price values in this table for ease of
presentation.)

The first possibility is to leave the natural monopoly alone. In this
case, the monopoly will follow its normal approach to maximizing
profits. It determines the quantity where MR = MC, which happens at
point P at a quantity of 4. The firm then looks to point A on the demand
curve to find that it can charge a price of 9.3 for that
profit-maximizing quantity. Since the price is above the average cost
curve, the natural monopoly would earn economic profits.

A second outcome arises if antitrust authorities decide to divide the
company, so that the new firms can compete. As a simple example, imagine
that the company is cut in half. Thus, instead of one large firm
producing a quantity of 4, two half-size firms each produce a quantity
of 2. Because of the declining average cost curve (AC), the average cost
of production for each of the half-size companies producing 2, as point
B shows, would be 9.75, while the average cost of production for a
larger firm producing 4 would only be 7.75. Thus, the economy would
become less productively efficient, since the good is produced at a
higher average cost. In a situation with a downward-sloping average cost
curve, two smaller firms will always have higher average costs of
production than one larger firm for any quantity of total output. In
addition, the antitrust authorities must worry that splitting the
natural monopoly into pieces may be only the start of their problems. If
one of the two firms grows larger than the other, it will have lower
average costs and may be able to drive its competitor out of the market.
Alternatively, two firms in a market may discover subtle ways of
coordinating their behavior and keeping prices high. Either way, the
result will not be the greater competition that was desired.

A third alternative is that regulators may decide to set prices and
quantities produced for this industry. The regulators will try to choose
a point along the market demand curve that benefits both consumers and
the broader social interest. Point C illustrates one tempting choice:
the regulator requires that the firm produce the quantity of output
where marginal cost crosses the demand curve at an output of 8, and
charge the price of 3.5, which is equal to marginal cost at that point.
This rule is appealing because it requires price to be set equal to
marginal cost, which is what would occur in a perfectly competitive
market, and it would assure consumers a higher quantity and lower price
than at the monopoly choice A. In fact, efficient allocation of
resources would occur at point C, since the value to the consumers of
the last unit bought and sold in this market is equal to the marginal
cost of producing it.

Attempting to bring about point C through force of regulation, however,
runs into a severe difficulty. At point C, with an output of 8, a price
of 3.5 is below the average cost of production, which is 5.7, so if the
firm charges a price of 3.5, it will be suffering losses. Unless the
regulators or the government offer the firm an ongoing public subsidy
(and there are numerous political problems with that option), the firm
will lose money and go out of business.

Perhaps the most plausible option for the regulator is point F; that is,
to set the price where AC crosses the demand curve at an output of 6 and
a price of 6.5. This plan makes some sense at an intuitive level: let
the natural monopoly charge enough to cover its average costs and earn a
normal rate of profit, so that it can continue operating, but prevent
the firm from raising prices and earning abnormally high monopoly
profits, as it would at the monopoly choice A. Determining this level of
output and price with the political pressures, time constraints, and
limited information of the real world is much harder than identifying
the point on a graph. For more on the problems that can arise from a
centrally determined price, see the discussion of price floors and price
ceilings in [Demand and
Supply](http://openstax.org/books/principles-microeconomics-3e/pages/3-introduction-to-demand-and-supply).

#### Cost-Plus versus Price Cap Regulation

Regulators of public utilities for many decades followed the general
approach of attempting to choose a point like F in [Figure
11.3](#CNX_Econ_C11_003). They calculated the average cost of production
for the water or electricity companies, added in an amount for the
normal rate of profit the firm should expect to earn, and set the price
for consumers accordingly. This method was known as cost-plus
regulation.

Cost-plus regulation raises difficulties of its own. If producers
receive reimbursement for their costs, plus a bit more, then at a
minimum, producers have less reason to be concerned with high
costs---because they can just pass them along in higher prices. Worse,
firms under cost-plus regulation even have an incentive to generate high
costs by building huge factories or employing many staff, because what
they can charge is linked to the costs they incur.

Thus, in the 1980s and 1990s, some public utility regulators began to
use price cap regulation, where the regulator sets a price that the firm
can charge over the next few years. A common pattern was to require a
price that declined slightly over time. If the firm can find ways of
reducing its costs more quickly than the price caps, it can make a high
level of profits. However, if the firm cannot keep up with the price
caps or suffers bad luck in the market, it may suffer losses. A few
years down the road, the regulators will then set a new series of price
caps based on the firm's performance.

Price cap regulation requires delicacy. It will not work if the price
regulators set the price cap unrealistically low. It may not work if the
market changes dramatically so that the firm is doomed to incurring
losses no matter what it does---say, if energy prices rise dramatically
on world markets, then the company selling natural gas or heating oil to
homes may not be able to meet price caps that seemed reasonable a year
or two ago. However, if the regulators compare the prices with producers
of the same good in other areas, they can, in effect, pressure a natural
monopoly in one area to compete with the prices charged in other areas.
Moreover, the possibility of earning greater profits or experiencing
losses---instead of having an average rate of profit locked in every
year by cost-plus regulation---can provide the natural monopoly with
incentives for efficiency and innovation.

With natural monopoly, market competition is unlikely to take root, so
if consumers are not to suffer the high prices and restricted output of
an unrestricted monopoly, government regulation will need to play a
role. In attempting to design a system of price cap regulation with
flexibility and incentive, government regulators do not have an easy
task.


### 11.4 The Great Deregulation Experiment

#### Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

-   Evaluate the effectiveness of price regulation and antitrust policy
-   Explain regulatory capture and its significance

Governments at all levels across the United States have regulated prices
in a wide range of industries. In some cases, like water and electricity
that have natural monopoly characteristics, there is some room in
economic theory for such regulation. However, once politicians are given
a basis to intervene in markets and to choose prices and quantities, it
is hard to know where to stop.

#### Doubts about Regulation of Prices and Quantities

Beginning in the 1970s, it became clear to policymakers of all political
leanings that the existing price regulation was not working well. The
United States carried out a great policy experiment---the deregulation
that we discussed in
[Monopoly](http://openstax.org/books/principles-microeconomics-3e/pages/9-introduction-to-a-monopoly)---removing
government controls over prices and quantities produced in airlines,
railroads, trucking, intercity bus travel, natural gas, and bank
interest rates. The Clear It Up discusses the outcome of deregulation in
one industry in particular---airlines.

#### Clear It Up {#clear-it-up .Heading3Grey}

##### What are the results of airline deregulation? {#what-are-the-results-of-airline-deregulation .Heading4Grey}

Why did the pendulum swing in favor of deregulation? Consider the
airline industry. In the early days of air travel, no airline could make
a profit just by flying passengers. Airlines needed something else to
carry and the Postal Service provided that something with airmail. Thus,
the first U.S. government regulation of the airline industry happened
through the Postal Service, when in 1926 the Postmaster General began
giving airlines permission to fly certain routes based on mail delivery
needs---and the airlines took some passengers along for the ride. In
1934, the antitrust authorities charged the Postmaster General with
colluding with the major airlines of that day to monopolize the nation's
airways. In 1938, the U.S. government created the Civil Aeronautics
Board (CAB) to regulate airfares and routes instead. For 40 years, from
1938 to 1978, the CAB approved all fares, controlled all entry and exit,
and specified which airlines could fly which routes. There was zero
entry of new airlines on the main routes across the country for 40
years, because the CAB did not think it was necessary.

In 1978, the Airline Deregulation Act took the government out of the
business of determining airfares and schedules. The new law shook up the
industry. Famous old airlines like Pan American, Eastern, and Braniff
went bankrupt and disappeared. Some new airlines like People Express
were created---and then vanished.

The greater competition from deregulation reduced airfares by about
one-third over the next two decades, saving consumers billions of
dollars a year. The average flight used to take off with just half its
seats full; now it is two-thirds full, which is far more efficient.
Airlines have also developed hub-and-spoke systems, where planes all fly
into a central hub city at a certain time and then depart. As a result,
one can fly between any of the spoke cities with just one
connection---and there is greater service to more cities than before
deregulation. With lower fares and more service, the number of air
passengers doubled from the late 1970s to the start of the 2000s---an
increase that, in turn, doubled the number of jobs in the airline
industry. Meanwhile, with the watchful oversight of government safety
inspectors, commercial air travel has continued to get safer over time.

The U.S. airline industry is far from perfect. For example, a string of
mergers in recent years has raised concerns over how competition might
be compromised.

One difficulty with government price regulation is what economists call
regulatory capture, in which the firms that are supposedly regulated end
up playing a large role in setting the regulations that they will
follow. When the airline industry was regulated, for example, it
suggested appointees to the regulatory board, sent lobbyists to argue
with the board, provided most of the information on which the board made
decisions, and offered well-paid jobs to at least some of the people
leaving the board. In this situation, it is easy for regulators to
poorly represent consumers. The result of regulatory capture is that
government price regulation can often become a way for existing
competitors to work together to reduce output, keep prices high, and
limit competition.

#### The Effects of Deregulation

Deregulation, both of airlines and of other industries, has its
negatives. The greater pressure of competition led to entry and exit.
When firms went bankrupt or contracted substantially in size, they laid
off workers who had to find other jobs. Market competition is, after
all, a full-contact sport.

A number of major accounting scandals involving prominent corporations
such as Enron, Tyco International, and WorldCom led to the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act in 2002. The government designed Sarbanes-Oxley to
increase confidence in financial information provided by public
corporations to protect investors from accounting fraud.

The Great Recession, which began in late 2007, was caused at least in
part by a global financial crisis, which began in the United States. The
key component of the crisis was the creation and subsequent failure of
several types of unregulated financial assets, such as collateralized
mortgage obligations (CMOs, a type of mortgage-backed security), and
credit default swaps (CDSs, insurance contracts on assets like CMOs that
provided a payoff even if the holder of the CDS did not own the CMO).
Private credit rating agencies such as Standard & Poors, Moody's, and
Fitch rated many of these assets very safe.

The collapse of the markets for these assets precipitated the financial
crisis and led to the failure of Lehman Brothers, a major investment
bank, numerous large commercial banks, such as Wachovia, and even the
Federal National Mortgage Corporation (Fannie Mae), which had to be
nationalized---that is, taken over by the federal government. One
response to the financial crisis was the Dodd-Frank Act, which majorly
attempted to reform the financial system. The legislation's purpose, as
noted on dodd-frank.com is:

> To promote the financial stability of the United States by improving
> accountability and transparency in the financial system, to end "too
> big to fail," to protect the American taxpayer by ending bailouts,
> \[and\] to protect consumers from abusive financial services
> practices. . .

All market-based economies operate against a background of laws and
regulations, including laws about enforcing contracts, collecting taxes,
and protecting health and the environment. The government policies that
we discussed in this chapter---like blocking certain anticompetitive
mergers, ending restrictive practices, imposing price cap regulation on
natural monopolies, and deregulation---demonstrate the role of
government to strengthen the incentives that come with a greater degree
of competition.

What did the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) decide on the Kinder Morgan
/ El Paso Corporation merger? After careful examination, federal
officials decided there was only one area of significant overlap that
might provide the merged firm with strong market power. The FTC approved
the merger, provided Kinder Morgan divest itself of the overlap area.
Tallgrass purchased Kinder Morgan Interstate Gas Transmission,
Trailblazer Pipeline Co. LLC, two processing facilities in Wyoming, and
Kinder Morgan's 50 percent interest in the Rockies Express Pipeline to
meet the FTC requirements. The FTC was attempting to strike a balance
between potential cost reductions resulting from economies of scale and
concentration of market power.

Did the price of natural gas decrease? Yes, rather significantly. In
2010, the wellhead price of natural gas was \$4.48 per thousand cubic
foot. In 2012 the price had fallen to just \$2.66. Was the merger
responsible for the large drop in price? The answer is uncertain. The
larger contributor to the sharp drop in price was the overall increase
in the supply of natural gas. Increasingly, more natural gas was able to
be recovered by fracturing shale deposits, a process called fracking.
Fracking, which is controversial for environmental reasons, enabled the
recovery of known reserves of natural gas that previously were not
economically feasible to tap. Kinder Morgan's control of 80,000-plus
miles of pipeline likely made moving the gas from wellheads to end users
smoother and allowed for an even greater benefit from the increased
supply.
