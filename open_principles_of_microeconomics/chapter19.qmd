### 19.1 Absolute and Comparative Advantage

#### Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

-   Define absolute advantage, comparative advantage, and opportunity
    costs
-   Explain the gains of trade created when a country specializes

The American statesman Benjamin Franklin (1706--1790) once wrote: "No
nation was ever ruined by trade." Many economists would express their
attitudes toward international trade in an even more positive manner.
The evidence that international trade confers overall benefits on
economies is pretty strong. Trade has accompanied economic growth in the
United States and around the world. Many of the national economies that
have shown the most rapid growth in the last several decades---for
example, Japan, South Korea, China, and India---have done so by
dramatically orienting their economies toward international trade. There
is no modern example of a country that has shut itself off from world
trade and yet prospered. To understand the benefits of trade, or why we
trade in the first place, we need to understand the concepts of
comparative and absolute advantage.

In 1817, David Ricardo, a businessman, economist, and member of the
British Parliament, wrote a treatise called *On the Principles of
Political Economy and Taxation*. In this treatise, Ricardo argued that
specialization and free trade benefit all trading partners, even those
that may be relatively inefficient. To see what he meant, we must be
able to distinguish between absolute and comparative advantage.

A country has an absolute advantage over another country in producing a
good if it uses fewer resources to produce that good. Absolute advantage
can be the result of a country's natural endowment. For example,
extracting oil in Saudi Arabia is pretty much just a matter of "drilling
a hole." Producing oil in other countries can require considerable
exploration and costly technologies for drilling and extraction---if
they have any oil at all. The United States has some of the richest
farmland in the world, making it easier to grow corn and wheat than in
many other countries. Guatemala and Colombia have climates especially
suited for growing coffee. Chile and Zambia have some of the world's
richest copper mines. As some have argued, "geography is destiny." Chile
will provide copper and Guatemala will produce coffee, and they will
trade. When each country has a product others need and it can produce it
with fewer resources in one country than in another, then it is easy to
imagine all parties benefitting from trade. However, thinking about
trade just in terms of geography and absolute advantage is incomplete.
Trade really occurs because of comparative advantage.

Recall from the chapter [Choice in a World of
Scarcity](http://openstax.org/books/principles-microeconomics-3e/pages/2-introduction-to-choice-in-a-world-of-scarcity)
that a country has a comparative advantage when it can produce a good at
a lower cost in terms of other goods. The question each country or
company should be asking when it trades is this: "What do we give up to
produce this good?" It should be no surprise that the concept of
comparative advantage is based on this idea of opportunity cost from
[Choice in a World of
Scarcity](http://openstax.org/books/principles-microeconomics-3e/pages/2-introduction-to-choice-in-a-world-of-scarcity).
For example, if Zambia focuses its resources on producing copper, it
cannot use its labor, land and financial resources to produce other
goods such as corn. As a result, Zambia gives up the opportunity to
produce corn. How do we quantify the cost in terms of other goods?
Simplify the problem and assume that Zambia just needs labor to produce
copper and corn. The companies that produce either copper or corn tell
you that it takes two hours to mine a ton of copper and one hour to
harvest a bushel of corn. This means the opportunity cost of producing a
ton of copper is two bushels of corn. The next section develops absolute
and comparative advantage in greater detail and relates them to trade.

#### A Numerical Example of Absolute and Comparative Advantage

Consider a hypothetical world with two countries, Saudi Arabia and the
United States, and two products, oil and corn. Further assume that
consumers in both countries desire both these goods. These goods are
homogeneous, meaning that consumers/producers cannot differentiate
between corn or oil from either country. There is only one resource
available in both countries, labor hours. Saudi Arabia can produce oil
with fewer resources, while the United States can produce corn with
fewer resources. [Table 19.1](#Table_33_01) illustrates the advantages
of the two countries, expressed in terms of how many hours it takes to
produce one unit of each good.

Table 19.1 How Many Hours It Takes to Produce Oil and Corn

In [Table 19.1](#Table_33_01), Saudi Arabia has an absolute advantage in
producing oil because it only takes an hour to produce a barrel of oil
compared to two hours in the United States. The United States has an
absolute advantage in producing corn.

To simplify, let's say that Saudi Arabia and the United States each have
100 worker hours (see [Table 19.2](#Table_33_02)). [Figure
19.2](#CNX_Econ_C33_010) illustrates what each country is capable of
producing on its own using a production possibility frontier (PPF)
graph. Recall from [Choice in a World of
Scarcity](http://openstax.org/books/principles-microeconomics-3e/pages/2-introduction-to-choice-in-a-world-of-scarcity)
that the production possibilities frontier shows the maximum amount that
each country can produce given its limited resources, in this case
workers, and its level of technology.

Table 19.2 Production Possibilities before Trade

![](media/19-1-absolute-and-comparative-advantage_rId30.jpeg){width="6.5in" height="2.625in"}

Figure 19.2 Production Possibilities Frontiers (a) Saudi Arabia can
produce 100 barrels of oil at maximum and zero corn (point A), or 25
bushels of corn and zero oil (point B). It can also produce other
combinations of oil and corn if it wants to consume both goods, such as
at point C. Here it chooses to produce/consume 60 barrels of oil,
leaving 40 work hours that to allocate to produce 10 bushels of corn,
using the data in [Table 19.1](#Table_33_01). (b) If the United States
produces only oil, it can produce, at maximum, 50 barrels and zero corn
(point A\'), or at the other extreme, it can produce a maximum of 100
bushels of corn and no oil (point B\'). Other combinations of both oil
and corn are possible, such as point C\'. All points above the frontiers
are impossible to produce given the current level of resources and
technology.

Arguably Saudi and U.S. consumers desire both oil and corn to live.
Let's say that before trade occurs, both countries produce and consume
at point C or C\'. Thus, before trade, the Saudi Arabian economy will
devote 60 worker hours to produce oil, as [Table 19.3](#Table_33_03)
shows. Given the information in [Table 19.1](#Table_33_01), this choice
implies that it produces/consumes 60 barrels of oil. With the remaining
40 worker hours, since it needs four hours to produce a bushel of corn,
it can produce only 10 bushels. To be at point C\', the U.S. economy
devotes 40 worker hours to produce 20 barrels of oil and it can allocate
the remaining worker hours to produce 60 bushels of corn.

Table 19.3 Production before Trade

The slope of the production possibility frontier illustrates the
opportunity cost of producing oil in terms of corn. Using all its
resources, the United States can produce 50 barrels of oil *or* 100
bushels of corn; therefore, the opportunity cost of one barrel of oil is
two bushels of corn---or the slope is 1/2. Thus, in the U.S. production
possibility frontier graph, every increase in oil production of one
barrel implies a decrease of two bushels of corn. Saudi Arabia can
produce 100 barrels of oil *or* 25 bushels of corn. The opportunity cost
of producing one barrel of oil is the loss of 1/4 of a bushel of corn
that Saudi workers could otherwise have produced. In terms of corn,
notice that Saudi Arabia gives up the least to produce a barrel of oil.
[Table 19.4](#Table_33_04) summarizes these calculations.

Table 19.4 Opportunity Cost and Comparative Advantage

Again recall that we defined comparative advantage as the opportunity
cost of producing goods. Since Saudi Arabia gives up the least to
produce a barrel of oil, ($\frac{\text{1}}{\text{4}}$ \< $\text{2}$ in
[Table 19.4](#Table_33_04)) it has a comparative advantage in oil
production. The United States gives up the least to produce a bushel of
corn, so it has a comparative advantage in corn production.

In this example, there is symmetry between absolute and comparative
advantage. Saudi Arabia needs fewer worker hours to produce oil
(absolute advantage, see [Table 19.1](#Table_33_01)), and also gives up
the least in terms of other goods to produce oil (comparative advantage,
see [Table 19.4](#Table_33_04)). Such symmetry is not always the case,
as we will show after we have discussed gains from trade fully, but
first, read the following Clear It Up feature to make sure you
understand why the PPF line in the graphs is straight.

#### Clear It Up {#clear-it-up .Heading3Grey}

##### Can a production possibility frontier be straight? {#can-a-production-possibility-frontier-be-straight .Heading4Grey}

When you first met the production possibility frontier (PPF) in the
chapter on [Choice in a World of
Scarcity](http://openstax.org/books/principles-microeconomics-3e/pages/2-introduction-to-choice-in-a-world-of-scarcity)
we drew it with an outward-bending shape. This shape illustrated that as
we transferred inputs from producing one good to another---like from
education to health services---there were increasing opportunity costs.
In the examples in this chapter, we draw the PPFs as straight lines,
which means that opportunity costs are constant. When we transfer a
marginal unit of labor away from growing corn and toward producing oil,
the decline in the quantity of corn and the increase in the quantity of
oil is always the same. In reality this is possible only if the
contribution of additional workers to output did not change as the scale
of production changed. The linear production possibilities frontier is a
less realistic model, but a straight line simplifies calculations. It
also illustrates economic themes like absolute and comparative advantage
just as clearly.

#### Gains from Trade

Consider the trading positions of the United States and Saudi Arabia
after they have specialized and traded. Before trade, Saudi Arabia
produces/consumes 60 barrels of oil and 10 bushels of corn. The United
States produces/consumes 20 barrels of oil and 60 bushels of corn. Given
their current production levels, if the United States can trade an
amount of corn fewer than 60 bushels and receive in exchange an amount
of oil greater than 20 barrels, it will gain from trade. With trade, the
United States can consume more of both goods than it did without
specialization and trade. (Recall that the chapter [Welcome to
Economics!](http://openstax.org/books/principles-microeconomics-3e/pages/1-introduction)
defined specialization as it applies to workers and firms. Economists
also use specialization to describe the occurrence when a country shifts
resources to focus on producing a good that offers comparative
advantage.) Similarly, if Saudi Arabia can trade an amount of oil less
than 60 barrels and receive in exchange an amount of corn greater than
10 bushels, it will have more of both goods than it did before
specialization and trade. [Table 19.5](#Table_33_05) illustrates the
range of trades that would benefit both sides.

Table 19.5 The Range of Trades That Benefit Both the United States and
Saudi Arabia

The underlying reason why trade benefits both sides is rooted in the
concept of opportunity cost, as the following Clear It Up feature
explains. If Saudi Arabia wishes to expand domestic production of corn
in a world without international trade, then based on its opportunity
costs it must give up four barrels of oil for every one additional
bushel of corn. If Saudi Arabia could find a way to give up less than
four barrels of oil for an additional bushel of corn (or equivalently,
to receive more than one bushel of corn for four barrels of oil), it
would be better off.

#### Clear It Up {#clear-it-up-1 .Heading3Grey}

##### What are the opportunity costs and gains from trade? {#what-are-the-opportunity-costs-and-gains-from-trade .Heading4Grey}

The range of trades that will benefit each country is based on the
country's opportunity cost of producing each good. The United States can
produce 100 bushels of corn or 50 barrels of oil. For the United States,
the opportunity cost of producing one barrel of oil is two bushels of
corn. If we divide the numbers above by 50, we get the same ratio: one
barrel of oil is equivalent to two bushels of corn, or (100/50 = 2 and
50/50 = 1). In a trade with Saudi Arabia, if the United States is going
to give up 100 bushels of corn in exports, it must import at least 50
barrels of oil to be just as well off. Clearly, to gain from trade it
needs to be able to gain more than a half barrel of oil for its bushel
of corn---or why trade at all?

Recall that David Ricardo argued that if each country specializes in its
comparative advantage, it will benefit from trade, and total global
output will increase. How can we show gains from trade as a result of
comparative advantage and specialization? [Table 19.6](#Table_33_06)
shows the output assuming that each country specializes in its
comparative advantage and produces no other good. This is 100%
specialization. Specialization leads to an increase in total world
production. (Compare the total world production in [Table
19.3](#Table_33_03) to that in [Table 19.6](#Table_33_06).)

Table 19.6 How Specialization Expands Output

What if we did not have complete specialization, as in [Table
19.6](#Table_33_06)? Would there still be gains from trade? Consider
another example, such as when the United States and Saudi Arabia start
at C and C\', respectively, as [Figure 19.2](#CNX_Econ_C33_010) shows.
Consider what occurs when trade is allowed and the United States exports
20 bushels of corn to Saudi Arabia in exchange for 20 barrels of oil.

![](media/19-1-absolute-and-comparative-advantage_rId40.jpeg){width="4.875in" height="3.7399989063867016in"}

Figure 19.3 Production Possibilities Frontier in Saudi Arabia Trade
allows a country to go beyond its domestic production-possibility
frontier

Starting at point C, which shows Saudi oil production of 60, reduce
Saudi oil domestic oil consumption by 20, since 20 is exported to the
United States and exchanged for 20 units of corn. This enables Saudi to
reach point D, where oil consumption is now 40 barrels and corn
consumption has increased to 30 (see [Figure 19.3](#CNX_Econ_C33_011)).
Notice that even without 100% specialization, if the "trading price," in
this case 20 barrels of oil for 20 bushels of corn, is greater than the
country's opportunity cost, the Saudis will gain from trade. Since the
post-trade consumption point D is beyond its production possibility
frontier, Saudi Arabia has gained from trade.

### 19.2 What Happens When a Country Has an Absolute Advantage in All Goods

#### Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

-   Show the relationship between production costs and comparative
    advantage
-   Identify situations of mutually beneficial trade
-   Identify trade benefits by considering opportunity costs

What happens to the possibilities for trade if one country has an
absolute advantage in everything? This is typical for high-income
countries that often have well-educated workers, technologically
advanced equipment, and the most up-to-date production processes. These
high-income countries can produce all products with fewer resources than
a low-income country. If the high-income country is more productive
across the board, will there still be gains from trade? Good students of
Ricardo understand that trade is about mutually beneficial exchange.
Even when one country has an absolute advantage in all products, trade
can still benefit both sides. This is because gains from trade come from
specializing in one's comparative advantage.

#### Production Possibilities and Comparative Advantage

Consider the example of trade between the United States and Mexico
described in [Table 19.7](#Table_33_08). In this example, it takes four
U.S. workers to produce 1,000 pairs of shoes, but it takes five Mexican
workers to do so. It takes one U.S. worker to produce 1,000
refrigerators, but it takes four Mexican workers to do so. The United
States has an absolute advantage in productivity with regard to both
shoes and refrigerators; that is, it takes fewer workers in the United
States than in Mexico to produce both a given number of shoes and a
given number of refrigerators.

Table 19.7 Resources Needed to Produce Shoes and Refrigerators

Absolute advantage simply compares the productivity of a worker between
countries. It answers the question, "How many inputs do I need to
produce shoes in Mexico?" Comparative advantage asks this same question
slightly differently. Instead of comparing how many workers it takes to
produce a good, it asks, "How much am I giving up to produce this good
in this country?" Another way of looking at this is that comparative
advantage identifies the good for which the producer's absolute
advantage is relatively larger, or where the producer's absolute
productivity disadvantage is relatively smaller. The United States can
produce 1,000 shoes with four-fifths as many workers as Mexico (four
versus five), but it can produce 1,000 refrigerators with only
one-quarter as many workers (one versus four). So, the comparative
advantage of the United States, where its absolute productivity
advantage is relatively greatest, lies with refrigerators, and Mexico's
comparative advantage, where its absolute productivity disadvantage is
least, is in the production of shoes.

#### Mutually Beneficial Trade with Comparative Advantage

When nations increase production in their area of comparative advantage
and trade with each other, both countries can benefit. Again, the
production possibility frontier is a useful tool to visualize this
benefit.

Consider a situation where the United States and Mexico each have 40
workers. For example, as [Table 19.8](#Table_33_09) shows, if the United
States divides its labor so that 40 workers are making shoes, then,
since it takes four workers in the United States to make 1,000 shoes, a
total of 10,000 shoes will be produced. (If four workers can make 1,000
shoes, then 40 workers will make 10,000 shoes). If the 40 workers in the
United States are making refrigerators, and each worker can produce
1,000 refrigerators, then a total of 40,000 refrigerators will be
produced.

Table 19.8 Production Possibilities before Trade with Complete
Specialization

As always, the slope of the production possibility frontier for each
country is the opportunity cost of one refrigerator in terms of foregone
shoe production--when labor is transferred from producing the latter to
producing the former (see [Figure 19.4](#CNX_Econ_C33_008)).

![](media/19-2-what-happens-when-a-country-has-an-absolute-advantage-in-all-goods_rId25.jpeg){width="6.5in" height="2.835in"}

Figure 19.4 Production Possibility Frontiers (a) With 40 workers, the
United States can produce either 10,000 shoes and zero refrigerators or
40,000 refrigerators and zero shoes. (b) With 40 workers, Mexico can
produce a maximum of 8,000 shoes and zero refrigerators, or 10,000
refrigerators and zero shoes. All other points on the production
possibility line are possible combinations of the two goods that can be
produced given current resources. Point A on both graphs is where the
countries start producing and consuming before trade. Point B is where
they end up after trade.

Let's say that, in the situation before trade, each nation prefers to
produce a combination of shoes and refrigerators that is shown at point
A. [Table 19.9](#Table_33_10) shows the output of each good for each
country and the total output for the two countries.

Table 19.9 Total Production at Point A before Trade

Continuing with this scenario, suppose that each country transfers some
amount of labor toward its area of comparative advantage. For example,
the United States transfers six workers away from shoes and toward
producing refrigerators. As a result, U.S. production of shoes decreases
by 1,500 units (6/4 × 1,000), while its production of refrigerators
increases by 6,000 (that is, 6/1 × 1,000). Mexico also moves production
toward its area of comparative advantage, transferring 10 workers away
from refrigerators and toward production of shoes. As a result,
production of refrigerators in Mexico falls by 2,500 (10/4 × 1,000), but
production of shoes increases by 2,000 pairs (10/5 × 1,000). Notice that
when both countries shift production toward each of their comparative
advantages (what they are relatively better at), their combined
production of both goods rises, as shown in [Table 19.10](#Table_33_11).
The reduction of shoe production by 1,500 pairs in the United States is
more than offset by the gain of 2,000 pairs of shoes in Mexico, while
the reduction of 2,500 refrigerators in Mexico is more than offset by
the additional 6,000 refrigerators produced in the United States.

Table 19.10 Shifting Production Toward Comparative Advantage Raises
Total Output

This numerical example illustrates the remarkable insight of comparative
advantage: even when one country has an absolute advantage in all goods
and another country has an absolute disadvantage in all goods, both
countries can still benefit from trade. Even though the United States
has an absolute advantage in producing both refrigerators and shoes, it
makes economic sense for it to specialize in the good for which it has a
comparative advantage. The United States will export refrigerators and
in return import shoes.

#### How Opportunity Cost Sets the Boundaries of Trade

This example shows that both parties can benefit from specializing in
their comparative advantages and trading. By using the opportunity costs
in this example, it is possible to identify the range of possible trades
that would benefit each country.

Mexico started out, before specialization and trade, producing 4,000
pairs of shoes and 5,000 refrigerators (see [Figure
19.4](#CNX_Econ_C33_008) and [Table 19.9](#Table_33_10)). Then, in the
numerical example given, Mexico shifted production toward its
comparative advantage and produced 6,000 pairs of shoes but only 2,500
refrigerators. Thus, if Mexico can export no more than 2,000 pairs of
shoes (giving up 2,000 pairs of shoes) in exchange for imports of at
least 2,500 refrigerators (a gain of 2,500 refrigerators), it will be
able to consume more of both goods than before trade. Mexico will be
unambiguously better off. Conversely, the United States started off,
before specialization and trade, producing 5,000 pairs of shoes and
20,000 refrigerators. In the example, it then shifted production toward
its comparative advantage, producing only 3,500 shoes but 26,000
refrigerators. If the United States can export no more than 6,000
refrigerators in exchange for imports of at least 1,500 pairs of shoes,
it will be able to consume more of both goods and will be unambiguously
better off.

The range of trades that can benefit both nations is shown in [Table
19.11](#Table_33_12). For example, a trade where the U.S. exports 4,000
refrigerators to Mexico in exchange for 1,800 pairs of shoes would
benefit both sides, in the sense that both countries would be able to
consume more of both goods than in a world without trade.

Table 19.11 The Range of Trades That Benefit Both the United States and
Mexico

Trade allows each country to take advantage of lower opportunity costs
in the other country. If Mexico wants to produce more refrigerators
without trade, it must face its domestic opportunity costs and reduce
shoe production. If Mexico, instead, produces more shoes and then trades
for refrigerators made in the United States, where the opportunity cost
of producing refrigerators is lower, Mexico can in effect take advantage
of the lower opportunity cost of refrigerators in the United States.
Conversely, when the United States specializes in its comparative
advantage of refrigerator production and trades for shoes produced in
Mexico, international trade allows the United States to take advantage
of the lower opportunity cost of shoe production in Mexico.

The theory of comparative advantage explains why countries trade: they
have different comparative advantages. It shows that the gains from
international trade result from pursuing comparative advantage and
producing at a lower opportunity cost. The following Work It Out feature
shows how to calculate absolute and comparative advantage and the way to
apply them to a country's production.

#### Work It Out {#work-it-out .Heading3Grey}

##### Calculating Absolute and Comparative Advantage {#calculating-absolute-and-comparative-advantage .Heading4Grey}

In Canada a worker can produce 20 barrels of oil or 40 tons of lumber.
In Venezuela, a worker can produce 60 barrels of oil or 30 tons of
lumber.

Table 19.12

a.  Who has the absolute advantage in the production of oil or lumber?
    How can you tell?
b.  Which country has a comparative advantage in the production of oil?
c.  Which country has a comparative advantage in producing lumber?
d.  In this example, is absolute advantage the same as comparative
    advantage, or not?
e.  In what product should Canada specialize? In what product should
    Venezuela specialize?

Step 1. Make a table like [Table 19.12](#Table_33_13).

Step 2. To calculate absolute advantage, look at the larger of the
numbers for each product. One worker in Canada can produce more lumber
(40 tons versus 30 tons), so Canada has the absolute advantage in
lumber. One worker in Venezuela can produce 60 barrels of oil compared
to a worker in Canada who can produce only 20.

Step 3. To calculate comparative advantage, find the opportunity cost of
producing one barrel of oil in both countries. The country with the
lowest opportunity cost has the comparative advantage. With the same
labor time, Canada can produce either 20 barrels of oil or 40 tons of
lumber. So in effect, 20 barrels of oil is equivalent to 40 tons of
lumber: 20 oil = 40 lumber. Divide both sides of the equation by 20 to
calculate the opportunity cost of one barrel of oil in Canada. 20/20 oil
= 40/20 lumber. 1 oil = 2 lumber. To produce one additional barrel of
oil in Canada has an opportunity cost of 2 lumber. Calculate the same
way for Venezuela: 60 oil = 30 lumber. Divide both sides of the equation
by 60. One oil in Venezuela has an opportunity cost of 1/2 lumber.
Because 1/2 lumber \< 2 lumber, Venezuela has the comparative advantage
in producing oil.

Step 4. Calculate the opportunity cost of one lumber by reversing the
numbers, with lumber on the left side of the equation. In Canada, 40
lumber is equivalent in labor time to 20 barrels of oil: 40 lumber = 20
oil. Divide each side of the equation by 40. The opportunity cost of one
lumber is 1/2 oil. In Venezuela, the equivalent labor time will produce
30 lumber or 60 oil: 30 lumber = 60 oil. Divide each side by 30. One
lumber has an opportunity cost of two oil. Canada has the lower
opportunity cost in producing lumber.

Step 5. In this example, absolute advantage is the same as comparative
advantage. Canada has the absolute and comparative advantage in lumber;
Venezuela has the absolute and comparative advantage in oil.

Step 6. Canada should specialize in the commodity for which it has a
relative lower opportunity cost, which is lumber, and Venezuela should
specialize in oil. Canada will be exporting lumber and importing oil,
and Venezuela will be exporting oil and importing lumber.

#### Comparative Advantage Goes Camping

To build an intuitive understanding of how comparative advantage can
benefit all parties, set aside examples that involve national economies
for a moment and consider the situation of a group of friends who decide
to go camping together. The six friends have a wide range of skills and
experiences, but one person in particular, Jethro, has done lots of
camping before and is also a great athlete. Jethro has an absolute
advantage in all aspects of camping: he is faster at carrying a
backpack, gathering firewood, paddling a canoe, setting up tents, making
a meal, and washing up. So here is the question: Because Jethro has an
absolute productivity advantage in everything, should he do all the
work?

Of course not! Even if Jethro is willing to work like a mule while
everyone else sits around, he, like all mortals, only has 24 hours in a
day. If everyone sits around and waits for Jethro to do everything, not
only will Jethro be an unhappy camper, but there will not be much output
for his group of six friends to consume. The theory of comparative
advantage suggests that everyone will benefit if they figure out their
areas of comparative advantage---that is, the area of camping where
their productivity disadvantage is least, compared to Jethro. For
example, it may be that Jethro is 80% faster at building fires and
cooking meals than anyone else, but only 20% faster at gathering
firewood and 10% faster at setting up tents. In that case, Jethro should
focus on building fires and making meals, and others should attend to
the other tasks, each according to where their productivity disadvantage
is smallest. If the campers coordinate their efforts according to
comparative advantage, they can all gain.


### 19.3 Intra-industry Trade between Similar Economies

#### Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

-   Identify at least two advantages of intra-industry trading
-   Explain the relationship between economies of scale and
    intra-industry trade

Absolute and comparative advantages explain a great deal about global
trading patterns. For example, they help to explain the patterns that we
noted at the start of this chapter, like why you may be eating fresh
fruit from Chile or Mexico, or why lower productivity regions like
Africa and Latin America are able to sell a substantial proportion of
their exports to higher productivity regions like the European Union and
North America. Comparative advantage, however, at least at first glance,
does not seem especially well-suited to explain other common patterns of
international trade.

#### The Prevalence of Intra-Industry Trade between Similar Economies

The theory of comparative advantage suggests that trade should happen
between economies with large differences in opportunity costs of
production. Roughly half of all U.S. trade involves shipping goods
between the fairly similar high-income economies of Japan, Canada, and
the United States. Furthermore, the trade has an important geographic
component---the biggest trading partners of the United States are Canada
and Mexico (see [Table 19.13](#Table_33_14)).

Table 19.13 Top Trading Partners (November 2021) (Source:
https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/statistics/highlights/toppartners.html)

Moreover, the theory of comparative advantage suggests that each economy
should specialize to a degree in certain products, and then exchange
those products. A high proportion of trade, however, is intra-industry
trade---that is, trade of goods within the same industry from one
country to another. For example, the United States produces and exports
autos and imports autos. [Table 19.14](#Table_33_15) shows some of the
largest categories of U.S. exports and imports. In all of these
categories, the United States is both a substantial exporter and a
substantial importer of goods from the same industry. In 2021, according
to the U.S. Census Bureau, the United States exported \$131 billion
worth of autos, and imported \$317 billion worth of autos. About 60% of
U.S. trade and 60% of European trade is intra-industry trade.

Why do similar high-income economies engage in intra-industry trade?
What can be the economic benefit of having workers of fairly similar
skills making cars, computers, machinery and other products which are
then shipped across the oceans to and from the United States, the
European Union, and Japan? There are two reasons: (1) The division of
labor leads to learning, innovation, and unique skills; and (2)
economies of scale.

#### Gains from Specialization and Learning

Consider the category of machinery, where the U.S. economy has
considerable intra-industry trade. Machinery comes in many varieties, so
the United States may be exporting machinery for manufacturing with
wood, but importing machinery for photographic processing. The
underlying reason why a country like the United States, Japan, or
Germany produces one kind of machinery rather than another is usually
not related to U.S., German, or Japanese firms and workers having
generally higher or lower skills. It is just that, in working on very
specific and particular products, firms in certain countries develop
unique and different skills.

Specialization in the world economy can be very finely split. In fact,
recent years have seen a trend in international trade, which economists
call splitting up the value chain. The value chain describes how a good
is produced in stages. As indicated in the beginning of the chapter,
producing the iPhone involves designing and engineering the phone in the
United States, supplying parts from Korea, assembling the parts in
China, and advertising and marketing in the United States. Thanks in
large part to improvements in communication technology, sharing
information, and transportation, it has become easier to split up the
value chain. Instead of production in a single large factory, different
firms operating in various places and even different countries can
divide the value chain. Because firms split up the value chain,
international trade often does not involve nations trading whole
finished products like automobiles or refrigerators. Instead, it
involves shipping more specialized goods like, say, automobile
dashboards or the shelving that fits inside refrigerators.
Intra-industry trade between similar countries produces economic gains
because it allows workers and firms to learn and innovate on particular
products---and often to focus on very particular parts of the value
chain.

#### Economies of Scale, Competition, Variety

A second broad reason that intra-industry trade between similar nations
produces economic gains involves economies of scale. The concept of
economies of scale, as we introduced in [Production, Costs and Industry
Structure](http://openstax.org/books/principles-microeconomics-3e/pages/7-introduction-to-production-costs-and-industry-structure),
means that as the scale of output goes up, average costs of production
decline---at least up to a point. [Figure 19.5](#CNX_Econ_C33_005)
illustrates economies of scale for a plant producing toaster ovens. The
horizontal axis of the figure shows the quantity of production by a
certain firm or at a certain manufacturing plant. The vertical axis
measures the average cost of production. Production plant S produces a
small level of output at 30 units and has an average cost of production
of \$30 per toaster oven. Plant M produces at a medium level of output
at 50 units, and has an average cost of production of \$20 per toaster
oven. Plant L produces 150 units of output with an average cost of
production of only \$10 per toaster oven. Although plant V can produce
200 units of output, it still has the same unit cost as Plant L.

In this example, a small or medium plant, like S or M, will not be able
to compete in the market with a large or a very large plant like L or V,
because the firm that operates L or V will be able to produce and sell
its output at a lower price. In this example, economies of scale operate
up to point L, but beyond point L to V, the additional scale of
production does not continue to reduce average costs of production.

![](media/19-3-intra-industry-trade-between-similar-economies_rId34.jpeg){width="3.25in" height="2.17in"}

Figure 19.5 Economies of Scale Production Plant S, has an average cost
of production of \$30 per toaster oven. Production plant M has an
average cost of production of \$20 per toaster oven. Production plant L
has an average cost of production of only \$10 per toaster oven.
Production plant V still has an average cost of production of \$10 per
toaster oven. Thus, production plant M can produce toaster ovens more
cheaply than plant S because of economies of scale, and plants L or V
can produce more cheaply than S or M because of economies of scale.
However, the economies of scale end at an output level of 150. Plant V,
despite being larger, cannot produce more cheaply on average than plant
L.

The concept of economies of scale becomes especially relevant to
international trade when it enables one or two large producers to supply
the entire country. For example, a single large automobile factory could
probably supply all the cars consumers purchase in a smaller economy
like the United Kingdom or Belgium in a given year. However, if a
country has only one or two large factories producing cars, and no
international trade, then consumers in that country would have
relatively little choice between kinds of cars (other than the color of
the paint and other nonessential options). Little or no competition will
exist between different car manufacturers.

International trade provides a way to combine the lower average
production costs that come from economies of scale and still have
competition and variety for consumers. Large automobile factories in
different countries can make and sell their products around the world.
If General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler were the only players in the U.S.
automobile market, the level of competition and consumer choice would be
considerably lower than when U.S. carmakers must face competition from
Toyota, Honda, Suzuki, Fiat, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Volkswagen, Kia,
Hyundai, BMW, Subaru, and others. Greater competition brings with it
innovation and responsiveness to what consumers want. America's car
producers make far better cars now than they did several decades ago,
and much of the reason is competitive pressure, especially from East
Asian and European carmakers.

#### Dynamic Comparative Advantage

The sources of gains from intra-industry trade between similar
economies---namely, the learning that comes from a high degree of
specialization and splitting up the value chain and from economies of
scale---do not contradict the earlier theory of comparative advantage.
Instead, they help to broaden the concept.

In intra-industry trade, climate or geography do not determine the level
of worker productivity. Even the general level of education or skill
does not determine it. Instead, how firms engage in specific learning
about specialized products, including taking advantage of economies of
scale determine the level of worker productivity. In this vision,
comparative advantage can be dynamic---that is, it can evolve and change
over time as one develops new skills and as manufacturers split the
value chain in new ways. This line of thinking also suggests that
countries are not destined to have the same comparative advantage
forever, but must instead be flexible in response to ongoing changes in
comparative advantage.


### 19.4 The Benefits of Reducing Barriers to International Trade

#### Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

-   Explain tariffs as barriers to trade
-   Identify at least two benefits of reducing barriers to international
    trade

Tariffs are taxes that governments place on imported goods for a variety
of reasons. Some of these reasons include protecting sensitive
industries, for humanitarian reasons, and protecting against dumping.
Traditionally, tariffs were used simply as a political tool to protect
certain vested economic, social, and cultural interests. The World Trade
Organization (WTO) is committed to lowering barriers to trade. The
world's nations meet through the WTO to negotiate how they can reduce
barriers to trade, such as tariffs. WTO negotiations happen in "rounds,"
where all countries negotiate one agreement to encourage trade, take a
year or two off, and then start negotiating a new agreement. The current
round of negotiations is called the Doha Round because it was officially
launched in Doha, the capital city of Qatar, in November 2001. In 2010,
the WTO noted that the Doha Round's emphasis on market access and
reforms of agricultural subsidies could add \$121--\$202 billion to the
world economy.

In the context of a global economy that currently produces more than
\$80 trillion of goods and services each year, this amount is not large:
it is an increase of less than 1%. But before dismissing the gains from
trade too quickly, it is worth remembering two points.

-   First, a gain of a few hundred billion dollars is enough money to
    deserve attention! Moreover, remember that this increase is not a
    one-time event; it would persist each year into the future.
-   Second, the estimate of gains may be on the low side because some of
    the gains from trade are not measured especially well in economic
    statistics. For example, it is difficult to measure the potential
    advantages to consumers of having a variety of products available
    and a greater degree of competition among producers. Perhaps the
    most important unmeasured factor is that trade between countries,
    especially when firms are splitting up the value chain of
    production, often involves a transfer of knowledge that can involve
    skills in production, technology, management, finance, and law.

Low-income countries benefit more from trade than high-income countries
do. In some ways, the giant U.S. economy has less need for international
trade, because it can already take advantage of internal trade within
its economy. However, many smaller national economies around the world,
in regions like Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia, have
much more limited possibilities for trade inside their countries or
their immediate regions. Without international trade, they may have
little ability to benefit from comparative advantage, slicing up the
value chain, or economies of scale. Moreover, smaller economies often
have fewer competitive firms making goods within their economy, and thus
firms have less pressure from other firms to provide the goods and
prices that consumers want.

The economic gains from expanding international trade are measured in
hundreds of billions of dollars, and the gains from international trade
as a whole probably reach well into the trillions of dollars. The
potential for gains from trade may be especially high among the smaller
and lower-income countries of the world.

some benefits of trade.

#### From Interpersonal to International Trade

Most people find it easy to believe that they, personally, would not be
better off if they tried to grow and process all of their own food, to
make all of their own clothes, to build their own cars and houses from
scratch, and so on. Instead, we all benefit from living in economies
where people and firms can specialize and trade with each other.

The benefits of trade do not stop at national boundaries, either.
Earlier we explained that the division of labor could increase output
for three reasons: (1) workers with different characteristics can
specialize in the types of production where they have a comparative
advantage; (2) firms and workers who specialize in a certain product
become more productive with learning and practice; and (3) economies of
scale. These three reasons apply from the individual and community level
right up to the international level. If it makes sense to you that
interpersonal, intercommunity, and interstate trade offer economic
gains, it should make sense that international trade offers gains, too.

International trade currently involves about \$20 trillion worth of
goods and services moving around the globe. Any economic force of that
size, even if it confers overall benefits, is certain to cause
disruption and controversy. This chapter has only made the case that
trade brings economic benefits. Other chapters discuss, in detail, the
public policy arguments over whether to restrict international trade.

#### Bring It Home {#bring-it-home .Heading3Grey}

##### Just Whose iPhone Is It? {#just-whose-iphone-is-it .Heading4Grey}

Apple Corporation uses a global platform to produce the iPhone. Now that
you understand the concept of comparative advantage, you can see why the
engineering and design of the iPhone is done in the United States. The
United States has built up a comparative advantage over the years in
designing and marketing products, and sacrifices fewer resources to
design high-tech devices relative to other countries. China has a
comparative advantage in assembling the phone due to its large skilled
labor force. Korea has a comparative advantage in producing components.
Korea focuses its production by increasing its scale, learning better
ways to produce screens and computer chips, and uses innovation to lower
average costs of production. Apple, in turn, benefits because it can
purchase these quality products at lower prices. Put the global assembly
line together and you have the device with which we are all so familiar.

### Introduction to International Trade

#### Bring It Home {#bring-it-home .Heading3Grey}

##### Just Whose iPhone Is It? {#just-whose-iphone-is-it .Heading4Grey}

The iPhone is a global product. Apple does not manufacture the iPhone
components, nor does it assemble them. The assembly is done by Foxconn
Corporation, a Taiwanese company, at its factories in China and India.
But, Samsung, the electronics firm and competitor to Apple, actually
supplies many of the parts that make up an iPhone. In earlier models,
Samsung parts made up as much as 26% of the total costs of production.
And in more recent versions, Samsung manufactures the displays and
cameras. In some ways, then, Samsung is both the biggest supplier and
biggest competitor for Apple. Why do these two firms work together to
produce the iPhone? To understand the economic logic behind
international trade, you have to accept, as these firms do, that trade
is about mutually beneficial exchange. Samsung is one of the world's
largest electronics parts suppliers. Apple lets Samsung focus on making
the best parts, which allows Apple to concentrate on its
strength---designing elegant products that are easy to use. If each
company (and by extension each country) focuses on what it does best,
there will be gains for all through trade.

We live in a global marketplace. The food on your table might include
fresh fruit from Chile, cheese from France, and bottled water from
Scotland. Your wireless phone might have been made in Taiwan or Korea.
The clothes you wear might be designed in Italy and manufactured in
China. The toys you give to a child might have come from India. The car
you drive might come from Japan, Germany, or Korea. The gasoline in the
tank might be refined from crude oil from Saudi Arabia, Mexico, or
Nigeria. As a worker, if your job is involved with farming, machinery,
airplanes, cars, scientific instruments, or many other
technology-related industries, the odds are good that a hearty
proportion of the sales of your employer---and hence the money that pays
your salary---comes from export sales. We are all linked by
international trade, and the volume of that trade has grown dramatically
in the last few decades.

The first wave of globalization started in the nineteenth century and
lasted up to the beginning of World War I. Over that time, global
exports as a share of global GDP rose from less than 1% of GDP in 1820
to 9% of GDP in 1913. As the Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman
of Princeton University wrote in 1995:

> It is a late-twentieth-century conceit that we invented the global

This first wave of globalization crashed to a halt early in the
twentieth century. World War I severed many economic connections. During
the Great Depression of the 1930s, many nations misguidedly tried to fix
their own economies by reducing foreign trade with others. World War II
further hindered international trade. Global flows of goods and
financial capital were rebuilt only slowly after World War II. It was
not until the early 1980s that global economic forces again became as
important, relative to the size of the world economy, as they were
before World War I.
