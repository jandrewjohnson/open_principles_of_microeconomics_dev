# Earth Economy Modeling

## Overview

* What is Earth-Economy modeling?

* How does this relate to big data

* Example research topics that use big data

* How does this connect to econometrics?

* Big data examples from my research

## To succeed in using this book

::: {.r-fit-text}  
::: {.incremental}

* Necessary to succeed: mastering software and code\.

  * Applied Economics itself is shifting in this direction\.

    * More focus on code expertise\.

    * Distinguishes us \(in a very positive way\) from traditional Econ programs\.

* In this book, we will use both R and Python

  * R is dominant in applied econometrics \(and thus is the basis of our department's coding approach\)

  * Other disciplines \(including machine learning\) use R much less

  * In your career\, you will likely have to learn new coding languages\.

    * Let's become bilingual\!

* I will lead the Python\-specific component of the course

  * Will walk you through installation\, language basics etc\.\, and then use it apply machine\-learning models to big data

## Your computer

::: {.r-fit-text}
- This course will build a modern "scientific computing stack" that is emerging among leading academics and open-source practitioners as an extremly powerful tool. We will work through installation of the programming language and several supporting tools\. 

- It is possible to use a PC\, Mac or Linux for this course\, though all examples will be given on a PC\.  Becoming skilled in Big Data is partly about mastering the tools and it will be your responsibility to come to class with your computer setup in a way for you to succeed\. We will discuss any setup steps necessary in the lecture before it is to be used\.

## What is big data?

::: {.r-fit-text}

* Big data means many things to different groups

  * Standard definition: Data sets that are so large or complex that traditional data processing applications are inadequate

    * Streams of data \(e\.g\.\, video collected by a self\-driving car\)

    * Massive consumer data \(they are watching you\)

    * Remotely sensed data \(satellites or drones taking pictures of the earth\)

    * Traditional data\, but just really big\.

* Many related subfields also constitute "what is" big data\.

  * Machine learning \(core to this course\)

  * Artificial Intelligence \(AI\)

  * Technological advancement in computer science and hardware

  * Econometrics exactly as we've done before\, but just with bigger tables\.

## Why should economists care about "big data"?

In the very least, it can create many new sources of useful data.

## But also for Voice  Analysis

Our input is time-series of amplitude of different pitches

But to be useful data, we probably want to know what is the **MEANING**? Here there are useful methods in Natural Language Processing.

## Big data from remote sensing (satellites)

![](../img/2023-01-03-13-47-26.png)

* Creates terabytes of information per day

  * Can assess economic factor like poverty

  * Or environmental factors like freshwater availability

* Data types:

  * Raster data \(matrices of spatial values\)

  * Vector data \(link databases of survey data to georeferenced household locations\)

# How does this connect to econometrics?

## 1.) Lots of data, same old econometrics

When  __n__  is very large \(or both  __n__  and  __k__  are\)

![](../img/2023-01-03-13-51-08.png)

## 2.) New prediction approaches


![](../img/2023-01-03-13-51-36.png)



## So we've got better models and huge data. What's the risk?

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="70%"}
* Requires rethinking what it means to be 'good' at prediction\.

  * In econometrics\, we often measure our prediction quality using  __in\-sample __ analysis\. For example\, with R2\.

  * Normally we cheer when our p\-values are tiny\.

  * With big data\, our p\-values are \(almost\) ALWAYS tiny\.

    * Is this a good thing?
:::

::: {.column width="30%"}
* In the Python component of the course\, we're going to introduce a new metric of prediction quality\.

  * __Out\-of\-sample__  prediction quality through cross\-validation\.

  * Has been around forever of course\, but big data greatly improves opportunities our ability to do cross\-validation\.

## Big Data improves opportunities for cross-validation


Cross-validation splitting and folding:

We'll learn this soon\.

## Model complexity


* With big data, you can make your model very, very complex

  * What is the risk of this?

    * Prediction error  __out of sample__  _ _ gets worse


![](../img/2023-01-03-13-52-19.png)

## Another term: overfitting vs underfitting

* Overfitting a model: making the model overly complex to that accuracy falls on the test data\.

  * We will talk about ways to methodologically hit the "sweet spot" of model complexity\.

## Criticism of Big Data



* Predicting the world with big data means we're focused \(obsessed?\) by how the world was    _in the past _   \(or at best\, present\)

  * Embeds racism\, sexism\, etc\.

  * Enables algorithmic discrimination

* Big data: not actually new \-\- just bigger\.
