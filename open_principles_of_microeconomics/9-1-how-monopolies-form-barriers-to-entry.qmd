## 9.1 How Monopolies Form: Barriers to Entry

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

-   Distinguish between a natural monopoly and a legal monopoly.
-   Explain how economies of scale and the control of natural resources
    led to the necessary formation of legal monopolies
-   Analyze the importance of trademarks and patents in promoting
    innovation
-   Identify examples of predatory pricing

Because of the lack of competition, monopolies tend to earn significant
economic profits. These profits should attract vigorous competition as
we described in [Perfect
Competition](http://openstax.org/books/principles-microeconomics-3e/pages/8-introduction-to-perfect-competition),
and yet, because of one particular characteristic of monopoly, they do
not. Barriers to entry are the legal, technological, or market forces
that discourage or prevent potential competitors from entering a market.
Barriers to entry can range from the simple and easily surmountable,
such as the cost of renting retail space, to the extremely restrictive.
For example, there are a finite number of radio frequencies available
for broadcasting. Once an entrepreneur or firm has purchased the rights
to all of them, no new competitors can enter the market.

In some cases, barriers to entry may lead to monopoly. In other cases,
they may limit competition to a few firms. Barriers may block entry even
if the firm or firms currently in the market are earning profits. Thus,
in markets with significant barriers to entry, it is *not* necessarily
true that abnormally high profits will attract new firms, and that this
entry of new firms will eventually cause the price to decline so that
surviving firms earn only a normal level of profit in the long run.

There are five types of monopoly, based on the types of barriers to
entry they exploit.

### Natural Monopoly

Economies of scale can combine with the size of the market to limit
competition. (We introduced this theme in [Production, Cost and Industry
Structure](http://openstax.org/books/principles-microeconomics-3e/pages/7-introduction-to-production-costs-and-industry-structure)).
[Figure 9.2](#CNX_Econ_C09_001) presents a long-run average cost curve
for the airplane manufacturing industry. It shows economies of scale up
to an output of 8,000 planes per year and a price of P~0~, then constant
returns to scale from 8,000 to 20,000 planes per year, and diseconomies
of scale at a quantity of production greater than 20,000 planes per
year.

Now consider the market demand curve in the diagram, which intersects
the long-run average cost (LRAC) curve at an output level of 5,000
planes per year and at a price P~1~, which is higher than P~0~. In this
situation, the market has room for only one producer. If a second firm
attempts to enter the market at a smaller size, say by producing a
quantity of 4,000 planes, then its average costs will be higher than
those of the existing firm, and it will be unable to compete. If the
second firm attempts to enter the market at a larger size, like 8,000
planes per year, then it could produce at a lower average cost---but it
could not sell all 8,000 planes that it produced because of insufficient
demand in the market.

Figure 9.2 Economies of Scale and Natural Monopoly In this market, the
demand curve intersects the long-run average cost (LRAC) curve at its
downward-sloping part. A natural monopoly occurs when the quantity
demanded is less than the minimum quantity it takes to be at the bottom
of the long-run average cost curve.

Economists call this situation, when economies of scale are large
relative to the quantity demanded in the market, a natural monopoly.
Natural monopolies often arise in industries where the marginal cost of
adding an additional customer is very low, once the fixed costs of the
overall system are in place. This results in situations where there are
substantial economies of scale. For example, once a water company lays
the main water pipes through a neighborhood, the marginal cost of
providing water service to another home is fairly low. Once the electric
company installs lines in a new subdivision, the marginal cost of
providing additional electrical service to one more home is minimal. It
would be costly and duplicative for a second water company to enter the
market and invest in a whole second set of main water pipes, or for a
second electricity company to enter the market and invest in a whole new
set of electrical wires. These industries offer an example where,
because of economies of scale, one producer can serve the entire market
more efficiently than a number of smaller producers that would need to
make duplicate physical capital investments.

A natural monopoly can also arise in smaller local markets for products
that are difficult to transport. For example, cement production exhibits
economies of scale, and the quantity of cement demanded in a local area
may not be much larger than what a single plant can produce. Moreover,
the costs of transporting cement over land are high, and so a cement
plant in an area without access to water transportation may be a natural
monopoly.

### Control of a Physical Resource

Another type of monopoly occurs when a company has control of a scarce
physical resource. In the U.S. economy, one historical example of this
pattern occurred when ALCOA---the Aluminum Company of
America---controlled most of the supply of bauxite, a key mineral used
in making aluminum. Back in the 1930s, when ALCOA controlled most of the
bauxite, other firms were simply unable to produce enough aluminum to
compete.

As another example, the majority of global diamond production is
controlled by DeBeers, a multi-national company that has mining and
production operations in South Africa, Botswana, Namibia, and Canada. It
also has exploration activities on four continents, while directing a
worldwide distribution network of rough cut diamonds. Although in recent
years they have experienced growing competition, their impact on the
rough diamond market is still considerable.

### Legal Monopoly

For some products, the government erects barriers to entry by
prohibiting or limiting competition. Under U.S. law, no organization but
the U.S. Postal Service is legally allowed to deliver first-class mail.
Many states or cities have laws or regulations that allow households a
choice of only one electric company, one water company, and one company
to pick up the garbage. Most legal monopolies are utilities---products
necessary for everyday life---that are socially beneficial. As a
consequence, the government allows producers to become regulated
monopolies, to ensure that customers have access to an appropriate
amount of these products or services. Additionally, legal monopolies are
often subject to economies of scale, so it makes sense to allow only one
provider.

### Promoting Innovation

Innovation takes time and resources to achieve. Suppose a company
invests in research and development and finds the cure for the common
cold. In this world of near ubiquitous information, other companies
could take the formula, produce the drug, and because they did not incur
the costs of research and development (R&D), undercut the price of the
company that discovered the drug. Given this possibility, many firms
would choose not to invest in research and development, and as a result,
the world would have less innovation. To prevent this from happening,
the Constitution of the United States specifies in Article I, Section 8:
"The Congress shall have Power . . . to Promote the Progress of Science
and Useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors
the Exclusive Right to their Writings and Discoveries." Congress used
this power to create the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, as well as
the U.S. Copyright Office. A patent gives the inventor the exclusive
legal right to make, use, or sell the invention for a limited time. In
the United States, exclusive patent rights last for 20 years. The idea
is to provide limited monopoly power so that innovative firms can recoup
their investment in R&D, but then to allow other firms to produce the
product more cheaply once the patent expires.

A trademark is an identifying symbol or name for a particular good, like
Chiquita bananas, Chevrolet cars, or the Nike "swoosh" that appears on
shoes and athletic gear. Between 2003 and 2019, roughly 6.8 million
trademarks were registered with the U.S. government. A firm can renew a
trademark repeatedly, as long as it remains in active use.

A copyright, according to the U.S. Copyright Office, "is a form of
protection provided by the laws of the United States for 'original works
of authorship' including literary, dramatic, musical, architectural,
cartographic, choreographic, pantomimic, pictorial, graphic, sculptural,
and audiovisual creations." No one can reproduce, display, or perform a
copyrighted work without the author\'s permission. Copyright protection
ordinarily lasts for the life of the author plus 70 years.

Roughly speaking, patent law covers inventions and copyright protects
books, songs, and art. However, in certain areas, like the invention of
new software, it has been unclear whether patent or copyright protection
should apply. There is also a body of law known as trade secrets. Even
if a company does not have a patent on an invention, competing firms are
not allowed to steal their secrets. One famous trade secret is the
formula for Coca-Cola, which is not protected under copyright or patent
law, but is simply kept secret by the company.

Taken together, we call this combination of patents, trademarks,
copyrights, and trade secret law intellectual property, because it
implies ownership over an idea, concept, or image, not a physical piece
of property like a house or a car. Countries around the world have
enacted laws to protect intellectual property, although the time periods
and exact provisions of such laws vary across countries. There are
ongoing negotiations, both through the World Intellectual Property
Organization (WIPO) and through international treaties, to bring greater
harmony to the intellectual property laws of different countries to
determine the extent to which those in other countries will respect
patents and copyrights of those in other countries.

Government limitations on competition used to be more common in the
United States. For most of the twentieth century, only one phone
company---AT&T---was legally allowed to provide local and long distance
service. From the 1930s to the 1970s, one set of federal regulations
limited which destinations airlines could choose to fly to and what
fares they could charge. Another set of regulations limited the interest
rates that banks could pay to depositors; yet another specified how much
trucking firms could charge customers.

What products we consider utilities depends, in part, on the available
technology. Fifty years ago, telephone companies provided local and long
distance service over wires. It did not make much sense to have many
companies building multiple wiring systems across towns and the entire
country. AT&T lost its monopoly on long distance service when the
technology for providing phone service changed from wires to microwave
and satellite transmission, so that multiple firms could use the same
transmission mechanism. The same thing happened to local service,
especially in recent years, with the growth in cellular phone systems.

The combination of improvements in production technologies and a general
sense that the markets could provide services adequately led to a wave
of deregulation, starting in the late 1970s and continuing into the
1990s. This wave eliminated or reduced government restrictions on the
firms that could enter, the prices that they could charge, and the
quantities that many industries could produce, including
telecommunications, airlines, trucking, banking, and electricity.

Around the world, from Europe to Latin America to Africa and Asia, many
governments continue to control and limit competition in what those
governments perceive to be key industries, including airlines, banks,
steel companies, oil companies, and telephone companies.

### Intimidating Potential Competition

Businesses have developed a number of schemes for creating barriers to
entry by deterring potential competitors from entering the market. One
method is known as predatory pricing, in which a firm uses the threat of
sharp price cuts to discourage competition. Predatory pricing is a
violation of U.S. antitrust law, but it is difficult to prove.

Consider a large airline that provides most of the flights between two
particular cities. A new, small start-up airline decides to offer
service between these two cities. The large airline immediately slashes
prices on this route to the bone, so that the new entrant cannot make
any money. After the new entrant has gone out of business, the incumbent
firm can raise prices again.

After the company repeats this pattern once or twice, potential new
entrants may decide that it is not wise to try to compete. Small
airlines often accuse larger airlines of predatory pricing: in the early
2000s, for example, ValuJet accused Delta of predatory pricing, Frontier
accused United, and Reno Air accused Northwest. In 2015, the Justice
Department ruled against American Express and Mastercard for imposing
restrictions on retailers that encouraged customers to use lower swipe
fees on credit transactions.

In some cases, large advertising budgets can also act as a way of
discouraging the competition. If the only way to launch a successful new
national cola drink is to spend more than the promotional budgets of
Coca-Cola and Pepsi Cola, not too many companies will try. A firmly
established brand name can be difficult to dislodge.

### Summing Up Barriers to Entry

[Table 9.1](#Table_09_01) lists the barriers to entry that we have
discussed. This list is not exhaustive, since firms have proved to be
highly creative in inventing business practices that discourage
competition. When barriers to entry exist, perfect competition is no
longer a reasonable description of how an industry works. When barriers
to entry are high enough, monopoly can result.
