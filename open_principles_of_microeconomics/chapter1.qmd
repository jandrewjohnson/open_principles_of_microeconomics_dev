### Introduction

#### Bring It Home {#bring-it-home .Heading3Grey}

##### Information Overload in the Information Age {#information-overload-in-the-information-age .Heading4Grey}

To post or not to post? Every day we are faced with a myriad of
decisions, from what to have for breakfast, to which show to stream, to
the more complex---"Should I double major and add possibly another
semester of study to my education?" Our response to these choices
depends on the information we have available at any given moment.
Economists call this "imperfect" because we rarely have all the data we
need to make perfect decisions. Despite the lack of perfect information,
we still make hundreds of decisions a day.

Streams, sponsors, and social media are altering the process by which we
make choices, how we spend our time, which movies we see, which products
we buy, and more. Whether they read the reviews or just check the
ratings, it\'s unlikely for Americans to make many significant decisions
without these information streams.

As you will see in this course, what happens in economics is affected by
how well and how fast information disseminates through a society, such
as how quickly information travels through Facebook. "Economists love
nothing better than when deep and liquid markets operate under
conditions of perfect information," says Jessica Irvine, National
Economics Editor for News Corp Australia.

This leads us to the topic of this chapter, an introduction to the world
of making decisions, processing information, and understanding behavior
in markets ---the world of economics. Each chapter in this book will
start with a discussion about current (or sometimes past) events and
revisit it at chapter's end---to "bring home" the concepts in play.

What is economics and why should you spend your time learning it? After
all, there are other disciplines you could be studying, and other ways
you could be spending your time. As the Bring it Home feature just
mentioned, making choices is at the heart of what economists study, and
your decision to take this course is as much as economic decision as
anything else.

Economics is probably not what you think. It is not primarily about
money or finance. It is not primarily about business. It is not
mathematics. What is it then? It is both a subject area and a way of
viewing the world.


### 1.1 What Is Economics, and Why Is It Important?

#### Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

-   Discuss the importance of studying economics
-   Explain the relationship between production and division of labor
-   Evaluate the significance of scarcity

Economics is the study of how humans make decisions in the face of
scarcity. These can be individual decisions, family decisions, business
decisions or societal decisions. If you look around carefully, you will
see that scarcity is a fact of life. Scarcity means that human wants for
goods, services and resources exceed what is available. Resources, such
as labor, tools, land, and raw materials are necessary to produce the
goods and services we want but they exist in limited supply. Of course,
the ultimate scarce resource is time- everyone, rich or poor, has just
24 expendable hours in the day to earn income to acquire goods and
services, for leisure time, or for sleep. At any point in time, there is
only a finite amount of resources available.

Think about it this way: In 2015 the labor force in the United States
contained over 158 million workers, according to the U.S. Bureau of
Labor Statistics. The total land area was 3,794,101 square miles. While
these are certainly large numbers, they are not infinite. Because these
resources are limited, so are the numbers of goods and services we
produce with them. Combine this with the fact that human wants seem to
be virtually infinite, and you can see why scarcity is a problem.

#### Introduction to FRED

Data is very important in economics because it describes and measures
the issues and problems that economics seek to understand. A variety of
government agencies publish economic and social data. For this course,
we will generally use data from the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank\'s
FRED database. FRED is very user friendly. It allows you to display data
in tables or charts, and you can easily download it into spreadsheet
form if you want to use the data for other purposes. The [FRED
website](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/categories/12) includes data on nearly 400,000
domestic and international variables over time, in the following broad
categories:

-   Money, Banking & Finance
-   Population, Employment, & Labor Markets (including Income
    Distribution)
-   National Accounts (Gross Domestic Product & its components), Flow of
    Funds, and International Accounts
-   Production & Business Activity (including Business Cycles)
-   Prices & Inflation (including the Consumer Price Index, the Producer
    Price Index, and the Employment Cost Index)
-   International Data from other nations
-   U.S. Regional Data
-   Academic Data (including Penn World Tables & NBER Macrohistory
    database)

For more information about how to use FRED, see the variety of
[videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaQWUgGG7V4&list=PLKcwEC4jDwiN5sOIay2qkpjTuvRTvkdso) on YouTube starting with
this introduction.

stark reminder that scarcity of resources is real. (Credit: \"Pittsburgh

If you still do not believe that scarcity is a problem, consider the
following: Does everyone require food to eat? Does everyone need a
decent place to live? Does everyone have access to healthcare? In every
country in the world, there are people who are hungry, homeless (for
example, those who call park benches their beds, as [Figure
1.2](#fig_1_2) shows), and in need of healthcare, just to focus
on a few critical goods and services. Why is this the case? It is
because of scarcity. Let's delve into the concept of scarcity a little
deeper, because it is crucial to understanding economics.

#### The Problem of Scarcity

Think about all the things you consume: food, shelter, clothing,
transportation, healthcare, and entertainment. How do you acquire those
items? You do not produce them yourself. You buy them. How do you afford
the things you buy? You work for pay. If you do not, someone else does
on your behalf. Yet most of us never have enough income to buy all the
things we want. This is because of scarcity. So how do we solve it?

#### Link It Up {#link-it-up .Heading3Grey}

Visit this [website](https://stateimpact.npr.org/texas/2013/08/02/how-10-western-cities-are-dealing-with-water-scarcity-and-drought/) to read about how the United States is dealing with scarcity in resources.

Every society, at every level, must make choices about how to use its
resources. Families must decide whether to spend their money on a new
car or a fancy vacation. Towns must choose whether to put more of the
budget into police and fire protection or into the school system.
Nations must decide whether to devote more funds to national defense or
to protecting the environment. In most cases, there just isn't enough
money in the budget to do everything. How do we use our limited
resources the best way possible, that is, to obtain the most goods and
services we can? There are a couple of options. First, we could each
produce everything we each consume. Alternatively, we could each produce
some of what we want to consume, and "trade" for the rest of what we
want. Let's explore these options. Why do we not each just produce all
of the things we consume? Think back to pioneer days, when individuals
knew how to do so much more than we do today, from building their homes,
to growing their crops, to hunting for food, to repairing their
equipment. Most of us do not know how to do all---or any---of those
things, but it is not because we could not learn. Rather, we do not have
to. The reason why is something called *the division and specialization
of labor*, a production innovation first put forth by Adam Smith
([Figure 1.3](#fig_1_3)) in his book, *The Wealth of Nations*.

![](media/1-1-what-is-economics-and-why-is-it-important_rId34.jpeg){width="6.5in" height="9.7in" #fig_1_3}

into discrete tasks. (Credit: \"Adam Smith\" by Cadell and Davies

#### The Division of and Specialization of Labor

The formal study of economics began when Adam Smith (1723--1790)
published his famous book *The Wealth of Nations* in 1776. Many authors
had written on economics in the centuries before Smith, but he was the
first to address the subject in a comprehensive way. In the first
chapter, Smith introduces the concept of division of labor, which means
that the way one produces a good or service is divided into a number of
tasks that different workers perform, instead of all the tasks being
done by the same person.

To illustrate division of labor, Smith counted how many tasks went into
making a pin: drawing out a piece of wire, cutting it to the right
length, straightening it, putting a head on one end and a point on the
other, and packaging pins for sale, to name just a few. Smith counted 18
distinct tasks that different people performed---all for a pin, believe
it or not!

Modern businesses divide tasks as well. Even a relatively simple
business like a restaurant divides the task of serving meals into a
range of jobs like top chef, sous chefs, less-skilled kitchen help,
servers to wait on the tables, a greeter at the door, janitors to clean
up, and a business manager to handle paychecks and bills---not to
mention the economic connections a restaurant has with suppliers of
food, furniture, kitchen equipment, and the building where it is
located. A complex business like a large manufacturing factory, such as
the shoe factory ([Figure 1.4](#fig_1_4)), or a hospital can
have hundreds of job classifications.

![](media/1-1-what-is-economics-and-why-is-it-important_rId40.jpeg){width="6.5in" height="4.333332239720035in" #fig_1_4}

of the divisions of labor. (Credit: \"Red Wing Shoe Factory Tour\" by

#### Why the Division of Labor Increases Production

When we divide and subdivide the tasks involved with producing a good or
service, workers and businesses can produce a greater quantity of
output. In his observations of pin factories, Smith noticed that one
worker alone might make 20 pins in a day, but that a small business of
10 workers (some of whom would need to complete two or three of the 18
tasks involved with pin-making), could make 48,000 pins in a day. How
can a group of workers, each specializing in certain tasks, produce so
much more than the same number of workers who try to produce the entire
good or service by themselves? Smith offered three reasons.

First, specialization in a particular small job allows workers to focus
on the parts of the production process where they have an advantage. (In
later chapters, we will develop this idea by discussing comparative
advantage.) People have different skills, talents, and interests, so
they will be better at some jobs than at others. The particular
advantages may be based on educational choices, which are in turn shaped
by interests and talents. Only those with medical degrees qualify to
become doctors, for instance. For some goods, geography affects
specialization. For example, it is easier to be a wheat farmer in North
Dakota than in Florida, but easier to run a tourist hotel in Florida
than in North Dakota. If you live in or near a big city, it is easier to
attract enough customers to operate a successful dry cleaning business
or movie theater than if you live in a sparsely populated rural area.
Whatever the reason, if people specialize in the production of what they
do best, they will be more effective than if they produce a combination
of things, some of which they are good at and some of which they are
not.

Second, workers who specialize in certain tasks often learn to produce
more quickly and with higher quality. This pattern holds true for many
workers, including assembly line laborers who build cars, stylists who
cut hair, and doctors who perform heart surgery. In fact, specialized
workers often know their jobs well enough to suggest innovative ways to
do their work faster and better.

A similar pattern often operates within businesses. In many cases, a
business that focuses on one or a few products (sometimes called its
"core competency") is more successful than firms that try to make a wide
range of products.

Third, specialization allows businesses to take advantage of economies
of scale, which means that for many goods, as the level of production
increases, the average cost of producing each individual unit declines.
For example, if a factory produces only 100 cars per year, each car will
be quite expensive to make on average. However, if a factory produces
50,000 cars each year, then it can set up an assembly line with huge
machines and workers performing specialized tasks, and the average cost
of production per car will be lower. The ultimate result of workers who
can focus on their preferences and talents, learn to do their
specialized jobs better, and work in larger organizations is that
society as a whole can produce and consume far more than if each person
tried to produce all of their own goods and services. The division and
specialization of labor has been a force against the problem of
scarcity.

#### Trade and Markets

Specialization only makes sense, though, if workers can use the pay they
receive for doing their jobs to purchase the other goods and services
that they need. In short, specialization requires trade.

You do not have to know anything about electronics or sound systems to
play music---you just buy an iPod or MP3 player, download the music, and
listen. You do not have to know anything about artificial fibers or the
construction of sewing machines if you need a jacket---you just buy the
jacket and wear it. You do not need to know anything about internal
combustion engines to operate a car---you just get in and drive. Instead
of trying to acquire all the knowledge and skills involved in producing
all of the goods and services that you wish to consume, the market
allows you to learn a specialized set of skills and then use the pay you
receive to buy the goods and services you need or want. This is how our
modern society has evolved into a strong economy.

#### Why Study Economics?

![](media/1-1-what-is-economics-and-why-is-it-important_rId53.jpeg){width="6.34in" height="2.63in" #fig_1_5}

Figure 1.5 Esther Duflo, Abhijit Banerjee, and Michael Kremer Esther
Duflo, Abhijit Banerjee (both from Massachusetts Institute of
Technology), and Michael Kremer (University of Chicago) were awarded the
Nobel Prize for groundbreaking work in which they established
experimental methods to understand poverty and outcomes of initiatives
to address it. (Credit: modification of work by U.S. Embassy

Now that you have an overview on what economics studies, let's quickly
discuss why you are right to study it. Economics is not primarily a
collection of facts to memorize, although there are plenty of important
concepts to learn. Instead, think of economics as a collection of
questions to answer or puzzles to work. Most importantly, economics
provides the tools to solve those puzzles.

Consider the complex and critical issue of education barriers on
national and regional levels, which affect millions of people and result
in widespread poverty and inequality. Governments, aid organizations,
and wealthy individuals spend billions of dollars each year trying to
address these issues. Nations announce the revitalization of their
education programs; tech companies donate devices and infrastructure,
and celebrities and charities build schools and sponsor students. Yet
the problems remain, sometimes almost as pronounced as they were before
the intervention. Why is that the case? In 2019, three
economists---Esther Duflo, Abhijit Banerjee, and Michael Kremer---were
awarded the Nobel Prize for their work to answer those questions. They
worked diligently to break the widespread problems into smaller pieces,
and experimented with small interventions to test success. The award
citation credited their work with giving the world better tools and
information to address poverty and improve education. Esther Duflo, who
is the youngest person and second woman to win the Nobel Prize in
Economics, said, \"We believed that like the war on cancer, the war on
poverty was not going to be won in one major battle, but in a series of
small triumphs. . . . This work and the culture of learning that it
fostered in governments has led to real improvement in the lives of
hundreds of millions of poor people."

As you can see, economics affects far more than business. For example:

-   Virtually every major problem facing the world today, from global
    warming, to world poverty, to the conflicts in Syria, Afghanistan,
    and Somalia, has an economic dimension. If you are going to be part
    of solving those problems, you need to be able to understand them.
    Economics is crucial.
-   It is hard to overstate the importance of economics to good
    citizenship. You need to be able to vote intelligently on budgets,
    regulations, and laws in general. When the U.S. government came
    close to a standstill at the end of 2012 due to the "fiscal cliff,"
    what were the issues? Did you know?
-   A basic understanding of economics makes you a well-rounded thinker.
    When you read articles about economic issues, you will understand
    and be able to evaluate the writer's argument. When you hear
    classmates, co-workers, or political candidates talking about
    economics, you will be able to distinguish between common sense and
    nonsense. You will find new ways of thinking about current events
    and about personal and business decisions, as well as current events
    and politics.

The study of economics does not dictate the answers, but it can
illuminate the different choices.


### 1.2 Microeconomics and Macroeconomics

#### Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

-   Describe microeconomics
-   Describe macroeconomics
-   Contrast monetary policy and fiscal policy

Economics is concerned with the well-being of *all* people, including
those with jobs and those without jobs, as well as those with high
incomes and those with low incomes. Economics acknowledges that
production of useful goods and services can create problems of
environmental pollution. It explores the question of how investing in
education helps to develop workers' skills. It probes questions like how
to tell when big businesses or big labor unions are operating in a way
that benefits society as a whole and when they are operating in a way
that benefits their owners or members at the expense of others. It looks
at how government spending, taxes, and regulations affect decisions
about production and consumption.

It should be clear by now that economics covers considerable ground. We
can divide that ground into two parts: Microeconomics focuses on the
actions of individual agents within the economy, like households,
workers, and businesses. Macroeconomics looks at the economy as a whole.
It focuses on broad issues such as growth of production, the number of
unemployed people, the inflationary increase in prices, government
deficits, and levels of exports and imports. Microeconomics and
macroeconomics are not separate subjects, but rather complementary
perspectives on the overall subject of the economy.

To understand why both microeconomic and macroeconomic perspectives are
useful, consider the problem of studying a biological ecosystem like a
lake. One person who sets out to study the lake might focus on specific
topics: certain kinds of algae or plant life; the characteristics of
particular fish or snails; or the trees surrounding the lake. Another
person might take an overall view and instead consider the lake\'s
ecosystem from top to bottom; what eats what, how the system stays in a
rough balance, and what environmental stresses affect this balance. Both
approaches are useful, and both examine the same lake, but the
viewpoints are different. In a similar way, both microeconomics and
macroeconomics study the same economy, but each has a different
viewpoint.

Whether you are scrutinizing lakes or economics, the micro and the macro
insights should blend with each other. In studying a lake, the micro
insights about particular plants and animals help to understand the
overall food chain, while the macro insights about the overall food
chain help to explain the environment in which individual plants and
animals live.

In economics, the micro decisions of individual businesses are
influenced by whether the macroeconomy is healthy. For example, firms
will be more likely to hire workers if the overall economy is growing.
In turn, macroeconomy\'s performance ultimately depends on the
microeconomic decisions that individual households and businesses make.

#### Microeconomics

What determines how households and individuals spend their budgets? What
combination of goods and services will best fit their needs and wants,
given the budget they have to spend? How do people decide whether to
work, and if so, whether to work full time or part time? How do people
decide how much to save for the future, or whether they should borrow to
spend beyond their current means?

What determines the products, and how many of each, a firm will produce
and sell? What determines the prices a firm will charge? What determines
how a firm will produce its products? What determines how many workers
it will hire? How will a firm finance its business? When will a firm
decide to expand, downsize, or even close? In the microeconomics part of
this book, we will learn about the theory of consumer behavior, the
theory of the firm, how markets for labor and other resources work, and
how markets sometimes fail to work properly.

#### Macroeconomics

What determines the level of economic activity in a society? In other
words, what determines how many goods and services a nation actually
produces? What determines how many jobs are available in an economy?
What determines a nation's standard of living? What causes the economy
to speed up or slow down? What causes firms to hire more workers or to
lay them off? Finally, what causes the economy to grow over the long
term?

We can determine an economy\'s macroeconomic health by examining a
number of goals: growth in the standard of living, low unemployment, and
low inflation, to name the most important. How can we use government
macroeconomic policy to pursue these goals? A nation\'s central bank
conducts monetary policy, which involves policies that affect bank
lending, interest rates, and financial capital markets. For the United
States, this is the Federal Reserve. A nation\'s legislative body
determines fiscal policy, which involves government spending and taxes.
For the United States, this is the Congress and the executive branch,
which originates the federal budget. These are the government\'s main
tools. Americans tend to expect that government can fix whatever
economic problems we encounter, but to what extent is that expectation
realistic? These are just some of the issues that we will explore in the
macroeconomic chapters of this book.


### 1.3 How Economists Use Theories and Models to Understand Economic Issues

#### Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

-   Interpret a circular flow diagram
-   Explain the importance of economic theories and models
-   Describe goods and services markets and labor markets

![](media/1-3-how-economists-use-theories-and-models-to-understand-economic-issues_rId22.jpeg){width="6.5in" height="7.8in" #fig_1_6}

Figure 1.6 John Maynard Keynes One of the most influential economists in
modern times was John Maynard Keynes. (Credit: "John Maynard Keynes" by
IMF/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)

John Maynard Keynes (1883--1946), one of the greatest economists of the
twentieth century, pointed out that economics is not just a subject area
but also a way of thinking. Keynes ([Figure 1.6](#fig_1_6))
famously wrote in the introduction to a fellow economist's book:
"\[Economics\] is a method rather than a doctrine, an apparatus of the
mind, a technique of thinking, which helps its possessor to draw correct
conclusions." In other words, economics teaches you how to think, not
what to think.

#### Link It Up {#link-it-up .Heading3Grey}

Watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRvaxUNDTKY) about John Maynard
Keynes and his influence on economics.

Economists see the world through a different lens than anthropologists,
biologists, classicists, or practitioners of any other discipline. They
analyze issues and problems using economic theories that are based on
particular assumptions about human behavior. These assumptions tend to
be different than the assumptions an anthropologist or psychologist
might use. A theory is a simplified representation of how two or more
variables interact with each other. The purpose of a theory is to take a
complex, real-world issue and simplify it down to its essentials. If
done well, this enables the analyst to understand the issue and any
problems around it. A good theory is simple enough to understand, while
complex enough to capture the key features of the object or situation
you are studying.

Sometimes economists use the term model instead of theory. Strictly
speaking, a theory is a more abstract representation, while a model is a
more applied or empirical representation. We use models to test
theories, but for this course we will use the terms interchangeably.

For example, an architect who is planning a major office building will
often build a physical model that sits on a tabletop to show how the
entire city block will look after the new building is constructed.
Companies often build models of their new products, which are more rough
and unfinished than the final product, but can still demonstrate how the
new product will work.

A good model to start with in economics is the circular flow diagram
([Figure 1.7](#fig_1_7)). It pictures the economy as consisting
of two groups---households and firms---that interact in two markets: the
goods and services market in which firms sell and households buy and the
labor market in which households sell labor to business firms or other
employees.

![](media/1-3-how-economists-use-theories-and-models-to-understand-economic-issues_rId33.jpeg){width="3.2666666666666666in"
height="2.2533333333333334in" #fig_1_7}

Figure 1.7 The Circular Flow Diagram The circular flow diagram shows how
households and firms interact in the goods and services market, and in
the labor market. The direction of the arrows shows that in the goods
and services market, households receive goods and services and pay firms
for them. In the labor market, households provide labor and receive
payment from firms through wages, salaries, and benefits.

Firms produce and sell goods and services to households in the market
for goods and services (or product market). Arrow "A" indicates this.
Households pay for goods and services, which becomes the revenues to
firms. Arrow "B" indicates this. Arrows A and B represent the two sides
of the product market. Where do households obtain the income to buy
goods and services? They provide the labor and other resources (e.g.,
land, capital, raw materials) firms need to produce goods and services
in the market for inputs (or factors of production). Arrow "C" indicates
this. In return, firms pay for the inputs (or resources) they use in the
form of wages and other factor payments. Arrow "D" indicates this.
Arrows "C" and "D" represent the two sides of the factor market.

Of course, in the real world, there are many different markets for goods
and services and markets for many different types of labor. The circular
flow diagram simplifies this to make the picture easier to grasp. In the
diagram, firms produce goods and services, which they sell to households
in return for revenues. The outer circle shows this, and represents the
two sides of the product market (for example, the market for goods and
services) in which households demand and firms supply. Households sell
their labor as workers to firms in return for wages, salaries, and
benefits. The inner circle shows this and represents the two sides of
the labor market in which households supply and firms demand.

This version of the circular flow model is stripped down to the
essentials, but it has enough features to explain how the product and
labor markets work in the economy. We could easily add details to this
basic model if we wanted to introduce more real-world elements, like
financial markets, governments, and interactions with the rest of the
globe (imports and exports).

Economists carry a set of theories in their heads like a carpenter
carries around a toolkit. When they see an economic issue or problem,
they go through the theories they know to see if they can find one that
fits. Then they use the theory to derive insights about the issue or
problem. Economists express theories as diagrams, graphs, or even as
mathematical equations. (Do not worry. In this course, we will mostly
use graphs.) Economists do not figure out the answer to the problem
first and then draw the graph to illustrate. Rather, they use the graph
of the theory to help them figure out the answer. Although at the
introductory level, you can sometimes figure out the right answer
without applying a model, if you keep studying economics, before too
long you will run into issues and problems that you will need to graph
to solve. We explain both micro and macroeconomics in terms of theories
and models. The most well-known theories are probably those of supply
and demand, but you will learn a number of others.


### 1.4 How To Organize Economies: An Overview of Economic Systems

#### Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

-   Contrast traditional economies, command economies, and market
    economies
-   Explain gross domestic product (GDP)
-   Assess the importance and effects of globalization

Think about what a complex system a modern economy is. It includes all
production of goods and services, all buying and selling, all
employment. The economic life of every individual is interrelated, at
least to a small extent, with the economic lives of thousands or even
millions of other individuals. Who organizes and coordinates this
system? Who ensures that, for example, the number of televisions a
society provides is the same as the amount it needs and wants? Who
ensures that the right number of employees work in the electronics
industry? Who ensures that televisions are produced in the best way
possible? How does it all get done?

There are at least three ways that societies organize an economy. The
first is the traditional economy, which is the oldest economic system
and is used in parts of Asia, Africa, and South America. Traditional
economies organize their economic affairs the way they have always done
(i.e., tradition). Occupations stay in the family. Most families are
farmers who grow the crops using traditional methods. What you produce
is what you consume. Because tradition drives the way of life, there is
little economic progress or development.

Figure 1.8 A Command Economy Ancient Egypt was an example of a command
economy. (Credit: \"Pyramids at Giza\" by Jay Bergesen/Flickr Creative
Commons, CC BY 2.0)

Command economies are very different. In a command economy, economic
effort is devoted to goals passed down from a ruler or ruling class.
Ancient Egypt was a good example: a large part of economic life was
devoted to building pyramids, like those in [Figure
1.8](#fig_1_8), for the pharaohs. Medieval manor life is
another example: the lord provided the land for growing crops and
protection in the event of war. In return, vassals provided labor and
soldiers to do the lord's bidding. In the last century, communism
emphasized command economies.

In a command economy, the government decides what goods and services
will be produced and what prices it will charge for them. The government
decides what methods of production to use and sets wages for workers.
The government provides many necessities like healthcare and education
for free. Currently, Cuba and North Korea have command economies.

Although command economies have a very centralized structure for
economic decisions, market economies have a very decentralized
structure. A market is an institution that brings together buyers and
sellers of goods or services, who may be either individuals or
businesses. The New York Stock Exchange ([Figure
1.9](#fig_1_9)) is a prime example of a market which brings
buyers and sellers together. In a market economy, decision-making is
decentralized. Market economies are based on private enterprise: the
private individuals or groups of private individuals own and operate the
means of production (resources and businesses). Businesses supply goods
and services based on demand. (In a command economy, by contrast, the
government owns resources and businesses.) Supply of goods and services
depends on what the demands are. A person's income is based on their
ability to convert resources (especially labor) into something that
society values. The more society values the person's output, the higher
the income (think Lady Gaga or LeBron James). In this scenario, market
forces, not governments, determine economic decisions.

Most economies in the real world are mixed. They combine elements of
command and market (and even traditional) systems. The U.S. economy is
positioned toward the market-oriented end of the spectrum. Many
countries in Europe and Latin America, while primarily market-oriented,
have a greater degree of government involvement in economic decisions
than the U.S. economy. China and Russia, while over the past several
decades have moved more in the direction of having a market-oriented
system, remain closer to the command economy end of the spectrum. The
Heritage Foundation provides perspective on countries' economic freedom,
as the following Clear It Up feature discusses.

#### Clear It Up {#clear-it-up .Heading3Grey}

##### What countries are considered economically free? {#what-countries-are-considered-economically-free .Heading4Grey}

Who is in control of economic decisions? Are people free to do what they
want and to work where they want? Are businesses free to produce when
they want and what they choose, and to hire and fire as they wish? Are
banks free to choose who will receive loans, or does the government
control these kinds of choices? Each year, researchers at the Heritage
Foundation and the *Wall Street Journal* look at 50 different categories
of economic freedom for countries around the world. They give each
nation a score based on the extent of economic freedom in each category.
Note that while the Heritage Foundation/WSJ index is widely cited by an
array of scholars and publications, it should be regarded as only one
viewpoint. Some experts indicate that the index's category choices and
scores are politically biased. However, the index and others like it
provide a useful resource for critical discussion of economic freedom.

The 2016 Heritage Foundation's Index of Economic Freedom report ranked
178 countries around the world: @tbl-table_01_01 lists some
examples of the most free and the least free countries. Although
technically not a separate country, Hong Kong has been granted a degree
of autonomy such that, for purposes of measuring economic statistics, it
is often treated as a separate country. Several additional countries
were not ranked because of extreme instability that made judgments about
economic freedom impossible. These countries include Afghanistan, Iraq,
Libya, Syria, Somalia, and Yemen.

The assigned rankings are inevitably based on estimates, yet even these
rough measures can be useful for discerning trends. In 2015, 101 of the
178 included countries shifted toward greater economic freedom, although
77 of the countries shifted toward less economic freedom. In recent
decades, the overall trend has been a *higher level of economic freedom
around the world*.

#### Regulations: The Rules of the Game

Markets and government regulations are always entangled. There is no
such thing as an absolutely free market. Regulations always define the
"rules of the game" in the economy. Economies that are primarily
market-oriented have fewer regulations---ideally just enough to maintain
an even playing field for participants. At a minimum, these laws govern
matters like safeguarding private property against theft, protecting
people from violence, enforcing legal contracts, preventing fraud, and
collecting taxes. Conversely, even the most command-oriented economies
operate using markets. How else would buying and selling occur? The
government heavily regulates decisions of what to produce and prices to
charge. Heavily regulated economies often have underground economies (or
black markets), which are markets where the buyers and sellers make
transactions without the government's approval.

The question of how to organize economic institutions is typically not a
straightforward choice between all market or all government, but instead
involves a balancing act over the appropriate combination of market
freedom and government rules.

#### The Rise of Globalization

Recent decades have seen a trend toward globalization, which is the
expanding cultural, political, and economic connections between people
around the world. One measure of this is the increased buying and
selling of goods, services, and assets across national borders---in
other words, international trade and financial capital flows.

Globalization has occurred for a number of reasons. Improvements in
shipping, as illustrated by the container ship in [Figure
1.10](#fig_1_10), and air cargo have driven down transportation
costs. Innovations in computing and telecommunications have made it
easier and cheaper to manage long-distance economic connections of
production and sales. Many valuable products and services in the modern
economy can take the form of information---for example: computer
software; financial advice; travel planning; music, books and movies;
and blueprints for designing a building. These products and many others
can be transported over telephones and computer networks at ever-lower
costs. Finally, international agreements and treaties between countries
have encouraged greater trade.

@tbl-table_01_02 presents one measure of globalization. It
shows the percentage of domestic economic production that was exported
for a selection of countries from 2010 to 2015, according to an entity
known as The World Bank. Exports are the goods and services that one
produces domestically and sells abroad. Imports are the goods and
services that one produces abroad and then sells domestically. Gross
domestic product (GDP) measures the size of total production in an
economy. Thus, the ratio of exports divided by GDP measures what share
of a country's total economic production is sold in other countries.

: The Extent of Globalization (exports/GDP) (Source:
http://databank.worldbank.org/data/) {#tbl-table_01_02}


In recent decades, the export/GDP ratio has generally risen, both
worldwide and for the U.S. economy. Interestingly, the share of U.S.
exports in proportion to the U.S. economy is well below the global
average, in part because large economies like the United States can
contain more of the division of labor inside their national borders.
However, smaller economies like Belgium, Korea, and Canada need to trade
across their borders with other countries to take full advantage of
division of labor, specialization, and economies of scale. In this
sense, the enormous U.S. economy is less affected by globalization than
most other countries.

@tbl-table_01_02 indicates that many medium and low income
countries around the world, like Mexico and China, have also experienced
a surge of globalization in recent decades. If an astronaut in orbit
could put on special glasses that make all economic transactions visible
as brightly colored lines and look down at Earth, the astronaut would
see the planet covered with connections.

Despite the rise in globalization over the last few decades, in recent
years we\'ve seen significant pushback against globalization from people
across the world concerned about loss of jobs, loss of political
sovereignty, and increased economic inequality. Prominent examples of
this pushback include the 2016 vote in Great Britain to exit the
European Union (i.e. Brexit), and the election of Donald J. Trump for
President of the United States.

Hopefully, you now have an idea about economics. Before you move to any
other chapter of study, be sure to read the very important @sec-appendix-a for additional discussion.
It is essential that you learn more about how to read and use models in
economics.

#### Bring It Home {#bring-it-home .Heading3Grey}

##### Information Overload in the Information Age {#information-overload-in-the-information-age .Heading4Grey}

The world provides nearly instant access to a wealth of information.
Consider that as recently as the late 1970s, the *Farmer's Almanac*,
along with the Weather Bureau of the U.S. Department of Agriculture,
were the primary sources American farmers used to determine when to
plant and harvest their crops. Today, these decisions are driven by
data. Farmers access detailed data streams driven by global positioning
systems, historical rainfall patterns, and complex weather monitoring
services. They combine this information with crop yield data and soil
quality measurements from prior years. Maximizing production efficiently
can mean the difference between a farm that remains profitable and one
that may need to sell its land, and data helps eliminate guesswork.

Information helps us make decisions as simple as what to wear today to
how many reporters the media should send to cover an event. Each of
these decisions is an economic decision. After all, resources are
scarce. If the media send ten reporters to cover an announcement, they
are not available to cover other stories or complete other tasks.
Information provides the necessary knowledge to make the best possible
decisions on how to utilize scarce resources. Welcome to the world of
economics!
