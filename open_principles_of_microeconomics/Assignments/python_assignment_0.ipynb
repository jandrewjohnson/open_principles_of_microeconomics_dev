    "1. Open a terminal to run Python. If you’re on Windows, you can do this in the start menu by searching for or finding “Miniforge Prompt”. On mac, you can just use the built in terminal.\n",

    "If you're looking for more, here is one extra task: Run this notebook in VS Code! We'll talk more about VS Code in the next class, so don't worry if this doesn't make sense. If you do want to run this, open it and then select \"Run All\" at the top of the editor. It will automatically output how well you did (worth no class credit). "
