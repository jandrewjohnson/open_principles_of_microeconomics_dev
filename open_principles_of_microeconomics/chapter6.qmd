#### Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

-   Propose decisions that maximize utility
-   Explain marginal utility and the significance of diminishing
    marginal utility

Information on the consumption choices of Americans is available from
the Consumer Expenditure Survey carried out by the U.S. Bureau of Labor
Statistics. [Table 6.1](#Table_06_01) shows spending patterns for the
average U.S. household. The first row shows income and, after taxes and
personal savings are subtracted, it shows that, in 2015, the average
U.S. household spent \$48,109 on consumption. The table then breaks down
consumption into various categories. The average U.S. household spent
roughly one-third of its consumption on shelter and other housing
expenses, another one-third on food and vehicle expenses, and the rest
on a variety of items, as shown. These patterns will vary for specific
households by differing levels of family income, by geography, and by
preferences.

#### Total Utility and Diminishing Marginal Utility

To understand how a household will make its choices, economists look at
what consumers can afford, as shown in a budget constraint (or budget
line), and the total utility or satisfaction derived from those choices.
In a budget constraint line, the quantity of one good is on the
horizontal axis and the quantity of the other good on the vertical axis.
The budget constraint line shows the various combinations of two goods
that are affordable given consumer income. Consider José\'s situation,
shown in [Figure 6.2](#CNX_Econ_C06_001). José likes to collect T-shirts
and watch movies.

In [Figure 6.2](#CNX_Econ_C06_001) we show the quantity of T-shirts on
the horizontal axis while we show the quantity of movies on the vertical
axis. If José had unlimited income or goods were free, then he could
consume without limit. However, José, like all of us, faces a budget
constraint. José has a total of \$56 to spend. The price of T-shirts is
\$14 and the price of movies is \$7. Notice that the vertical intercept
of the budget constraint line is at eight movies and zero T-shirts
(\$56/\$7=8). The horizontal intercept of the budget constraint is four,
where José spends of all of his money on T-shirts and no movies
(\$56/14=4). The slope of the budget constraint line is rise/run or
--8/4=--2. The specific choices along the budget constraint line show
the combinations of affordable T-shirts and movies.

Figure 6.2 A Choice between Consumption Goods José has income of \$56.
Movies cost \$7 and T-shirts cost \$14. The points on the budget
constraint line show the combinations of affordable movies and T-shirts.

José wishes to choose the combination that will provide him with the
greatest utility, which is the term economists use to describe a
person's level of satisfaction or happiness with their choices.

Let's begin with an assumption, which we will discuss in more detail
later, that José can measure his own utility with something called
*utils*. (It is important to note that you cannot make comparisons
between the utils of individuals. If one person gets 20 utils from a cup
of coffee and another gets 10 utils, this does not mean than the first
person gets more enjoyment from the coffee than the other or that they
enjoy the coffee twice as much. The reason why is that utils are
subjective to an individual. The way one person measures utils is not
the same as the way someone else does.) [Table 6.2](#Table_06_02) shows
how José's utility is connected with his T-shirt or movie consumption.
The first column of the table shows the quantity of T-shirts consumed.
The second column shows the total utility, or total amount of
satisfaction, that José receives from consuming that number of T-shirts.
The most common pattern of total utility, in this example, is that
consuming additional goods leads to greater total utility, but at a
decreasing rate. The third column shows marginal utility, which is the
additional utility provided by one additional unit of consumption. This
equation for marginal utility is:

![multiline equation row 1 MU equals change in total utility divided by
change in quantity](media/rId31.png){width="1.5625in"
height="0.23958333333333334in"}

Notice that marginal utility diminishes as additional units are
consumed, which means that each subsequent unit of a good consumed
provides less *additional* utility. For example, the first T-shirt José
picks is his favorite and it gives him an addition of 22 utils. The
fourth T-shirt is just something to wear when all his other clothes are
in the wash and yields only 18 additional utils. This is an example of
the law of diminishing marginal utility, which holds that the additional
utility decreases with each unit added. Diminishing marginal utility is
another example of the more general law of diminishing returns we
learned earlier in the chapter on [Choice in a World of
Scarcity](http://openstax.org/books/principles-microeconomics-3e/pages/2-introduction-to-choice-in-a-world-of-scarcity).

The rest of [Table 6.2](#Table_06_02) shows the quantity of movies that
José attends, and his total and marginal utility from seeing each movie.
Total utility follows the expected pattern: it increases as the number
of movies that José watches rises. Marginal utility also follows the
expected pattern: each additional movie brings a smaller gain in utility
than the previous one. The first movie José attends is the one he wanted
to see the most, and thus provides him with the highest level of utility
or satisfaction. The fifth movie he attends is just to kill time. Notice
that total utility is also the sum of the marginal utilities. Read the
next Work It Out feature for instructions on how to calculate total
utility.

Table 6.2 Total and Marginal Utility

[Table 6.3](#Table_06_03) looks at each point on the budget constraint
in [Figure 6.2](#CNX_Econ_C06_001), and adds up José's total utility for
five possible combinations of T-shirts and movies.

Table 6.3 Finding the Choice with the Highest Utility

#### Work It Out {#work-it-out .Heading3Grey}

##### Calculating Total Utility {#calculating-total-utility .Heading4Grey}

Let's look at how José makes his decision in more detail.

Step 1. Observe that, at point Q (for example), José consumes three
T-shirts and two movies.

Step 2. Look at [Table 6.2](#Table_06_02). You can see from the fourth
row/second column that three T-shirts are worth 63 utils. Similarly, the
second row/fifth column shows that two movies are worth 31 utils.

Step 3. From this information, you can calculate that point Q has a
total utility of 94 (63 + 31).

Step 4. You can repeat the same calculations for each point on [Table
6.3](#Table_06_03), in which the total utility numbers are shown in the
last column.

For José, the highest total utility for all possible combinations of
goods occurs at point S, with a total utility of 103 from consuming one
T-shirt and six movies.

#### Choosing with Marginal Utility

Most people approach their utility-maximizing combination of choices in
a step-by-step way. This approach is based on looking at the tradeoffs,
measured in terms of marginal utility, of consuming less of one good and
more of another.

For example, say that José starts off thinking about spending all his
money on T-shirts and choosing point P, which corresponds to four
T-shirts and no movies, as [Figure 6.2](#CNX_Econ_C06_001) illustrates.
José chooses this starting point randomly as he has to start somewhere.
Then he considers giving up the last T-shirt, the one that provides him
the least marginal utility, and using the money he saves to buy two
movies instead. [Table 6.4](#Table_06_04) tracks the step-by-step series
of decisions José needs to make (*Key*: T-shirts are \$14, movies are
\$7, and income is \$56). The following Work It Out feature explains how
marginal utility can affect decision making.

Table 6.4 A Step-by-Step Approach to Maximizing Utility

#### Work It Out {#work-it-out-1 .Heading3Grey}

##### Decision Making by Comparing Marginal Utility {#decision-making-by-comparing-marginal-utility .Heading4Grey}

José could use the following thought process (if he thought in utils) to
make his decision regarding how many T-shirts and movies to purchase:

Step 1. From [Table 6.2](#Table_06_02), José can see that the marginal
utility of the fourth T-shirt is 18. If José gives up the fourth
T-shirt, then he loses 18 utils.

Step 2. Giving up the fourth T-shirt, however, frees up \$14 (the price
of a T-shirt), allowing José to buy the first two movies (at \$7 each).

Step 3. José knows that the marginal utility of the first movie is 16
and the marginal utility of the second movie is 15. Thus, if José moves
from point P to point Q, he gives up 18 utils (from the T-shirt), but
gains 31 utils (from the movies).

Step 4. Gaining 31 utils and losing 18 utils is a net gain of 13. This
is just another way of saying that the total utility at Q (94 according
to the last column in [Table 6.3](#Table_06_03)) is 13 more than the
total utility at P (81).

Step 5. Thus, for José, it makes sense to give up the fourth T-shirt in
order to buy two movies.

José clearly prefers point Q to point P. Now repeat this step-by-step
process of decision making with marginal utilities. José thinks about
giving up the third T-shirt and surrendering a marginal utility of 20,
in exchange for purchasing two more movies that promise a combined
marginal utility of 27. José prefers point R to point Q. What if José
thinks about going beyond R to point S? Giving up the second T-shirt
means a marginal utility loss of 21, and the marginal utility gain from
the fifth and sixth movies would combine to make a marginal utility gain
of 23, so José prefers point S to R.

However, if José seeks to go beyond point S to point T, he finds that
the loss of marginal utility from giving up the first T-shirt is 22,
while the marginal utility gain from the last two movies is only a total
of 19. If José were to choose point T, his utility would fall to 100.
Through these stages of thinking about marginal tradeoffs, José again
concludes that S, with one T-shirt and six movies, is the choice that
will provide him with the highest level of total utility. This
step-by-step approach will reach the same conclusion regardless of
José's starting point.

We can develop a more systematic way of using this approach by focusing
on satisfaction per dollar. If an item costing \$5 yields 10 utils, then
it's worth 2 utils per dollar spent. Marginal utility per dollar is the
amount of additional utility José receives divided by the product\'s
price. [Table 6.5](#Table_06_05) shows the marginal utility per dollar
for José\'s T shirts and movies.

![multiline equation row 1 marginal utility per dollar equals marginal
utility divided by price](media/rId40.png){width="2.7916666666666665in"
height="0.23958333333333334in"}

If José wants to maximize the utility he gets from his limited budget,
he will always purchase the item with the greatest marginal utility per
dollar of expenditure (assuming he can afford it with his remaining
budget). José starts with no purchases. If he purchases a T-shirt, the
marginal utility per dollar spent will be 1.6. If he purchases a movie,
the marginal utility per dollar spent will be 2.3. Therefore, José's
first purchase will be the movie. Why? Because it gives him the highest
marginal utility per dollar and is affordable. Next, José will purchase
another movie. Why? Because the marginal utility of the next movie
(2.14) is greater than the marginal utility of the next T-shirt (1.6).
Note that when José has no T- shirts, the next one is the first one.
José will continue to purchase the next good with the highest marginal
utility per dollar until he exhausts his budget. He will continue
purchasing movies because they give him a greater \"bang for the buck\"
until the sixth movie which gives the same marginal utility per dollar
as the first T-shirt purchase. José has just enough budget to purchase
both. So in total, José will purchase six movies and one T-shirt.

Table 6.5 Marginal Utility per Dollar

#### A Rule for Maximizing Utility

This process of decision making suggests a rule to follow when
maximizing utility. Since the price of T-shirts is twice as high as the
price of movies, to maximize utility the last T-shirt that José chose
needs to provide exactly twice the marginal utility (MU) of the last
movie. If the last T-shirt provides less than twice the marginal utility
of the last movie, then the T-shirt is providing less "bang for the
buck" (i.e., marginal utility per dollar spent) than José would receive
from spending the same money on movies. If this is so, José should trade
the T-shirt for more movies to increase his total utility.

If the last T-shirt provides more than twice the marginal utility of the
last movie, then the T-shirt is providing more "bang for the buck" or
marginal utility per dollar, than if the money were spent on movies. As
a result, José should buy more T-shirts. Notice that at José's optimal
choice of point S, the marginal utility from the first T-shirt, of 22 is
exactly twice the marginal utility of the sixth movie, which is 11. At
this choice, the marginal utility per dollar is the same for both goods.
This is a tell-tale signal that José has found the point with highest
total utility.

We can write this argument as a general rule: If you always choose the
item with the greatest marginal utility per dollar spent, when your
budget is exhausted, the utility maximizing choice should occur where
the marginal utility per dollar spent is the same for both goods.

![multiline equation row 1 MU sub one divided by cap P sub one equals MU
sub two divided by cap P sub
two](media/rId45.png){width="0.7708333333333334in"
height="0.22916666666666666in"}

A sensible economizer will pay twice as much for something only if, in
the marginal comparison, the item confers twice as much utility. Notice
that the formula for the table above is:

![multiline equation row 1 22 divided by dollar sign 14 equals 11
divided by dollar sign seven row 2 1.6 equals
1.6](media/rId47.png){width="0.6041666666666666in" height="0.4375in"}

The following Work It Out feature provides step by step guidance for
this concept of utility-maximizing choices.

#### Work It Out {#work-it-out-2 .Heading3Grey}

##### Maximizing Utility {#maximizing-utility .Heading4Grey}

The general rule, ![multiline equation row 1 MU sub one divided by cap P
sub one equals MU sub two divided by cap P sub
two](media/rId45.png){width="0.7708333333333334in"
height="0.22916666666666666in"}, means that the last dollar spent on
each good provides exactly the same marginal utility. This is the case
at point S. So:

Step 1. If we traded a dollar more of movies for a dollar more of
T-shirts, the marginal utility gained from T-shirts would exactly offset
the marginal utility lost from fewer movies. In other words, the net
gain would be zero.

Step 2. Products, however, usually cost more than a dollar, so we cannot
trade a dollar's worth of movies. The best we can do is trade two movies
for another T-shirt, since in this example T-shirts cost twice what a
movie does.

Step 3. If we trade two movies for one T-shirt, we would end up at point
R (two T-shirts and four movies).

Step 4. Choice 4 in [Table 6.4](#Table_06_04) shows that if we move to
point R, we would gain 21 utils from one more T-shirt, but lose 23 utils
from two fewer movies, so we would end up with less total utility at
point R.

In short, the general rule shows us the utility-maximizing choice, which
is called the consumer equilibrium.

There is another equivalent way to think about this. We can also express
the general rule as *the ratio of the prices of the two goods should be
equal to the ratio of the marginal utilities.* When we divide the price
of good 1 by the price of good 2, at the utility-maximizing point this
will equal the marginal utility of good 1 divided by the marginal
utility of good 2.

![multiline equation row 1 cap P sub one divided by cap P sub two equals
MU sub one divided by MU sub
two](media/rId51.png){width="0.6666666666666666in"
height="0.22916666666666666in"}

Along the budget constraint, the total price of the two goods remains
the same, so the ratio of the prices does not change. However, the
marginal utility of the two goods changes with the quantities consumed.
At the optimal choice of one T-shirt and six movies, point S, the ratio
of marginal utility to price for T-shirts (22:14) matches the ratio of
marginal utility to price for movies (of 11:7).

#### Measuring Utility with Numbers

This discussion of utility began with an assumption that it is possible
to place numerical values on utility, an assumption that may seem
questionable. You can buy a thermometer for measuring temperature at the
hardware store, but what store sells a "utilimometer" for measuring
utility? While measuring utility with numbers is a convenient assumption
to clarify the explanation, the key assumption is not that an outside
party can measure utility but only that individuals can decide which of
two alternatives they prefer.

To understand this point, think back to the step-by-step process of
finding the choice with highest total utility by comparing the marginal
utility you gain and lose from different choices along the budget
constraint. As José compares each choice along his budget constraint to
the previous choice, what matters is not the specific numbers that he
places on his utility---or whether he uses any numbers at all---but only
that he personally can identify which choices he prefers.

In this way, the step-by-step process of choosing the highest level of
utility resembles rather closely how many people make consumption
decisions. We think about what will make us the happiest. We think about
what things cost. We think about buying a little more of one item and
giving up a little of something else. We choose what provides us with
the greatest level of satisfaction. The vocabulary of comparing the
points along a budget constraint and total and marginal utility is just
a set of tools for discussing this everyday process in a clear and
specific manner. It is welcome news that specific utility numbers are
not central to the argument, since a good utilimometer is hard to find.
Do not worry---while we cannot measure utils, by the end of the next
module, we will have transformed our analysis into something we can
measure---demand.


### 6.2 How Changes in Income and Prices Affect Consumption Choices

#### Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

-   Explain how income, prices, and preferences affect consumer choices
-   Contrast the substitution effect and the income effect
-   Utilize concepts of demand to analyze consumer choices
-   Apply utility-maximizing choices to governments and businesses

Just as we can use utility and marginal utility to discuss making
consumer choices along a budget constraint, we can also use these ideas
to think about how consumer choices change when the budget constraint
shifts in response to changes in income or price. Because we can use the
budget constraint framework to analyze how quantities demanded change
because of price movements, the budget constraint model can illustrate
the underlying logic behind demand curves.

#### How Changes in Income Affect Consumer Choices

Let's begin with a concrete example illustrating how changes in income
level affect consumer choices. [Figure 6.3](#CNX_Econ_C06_002) shows a
budget constraint that represents Kimberly's choice between concert
tickets at \$50 each and getting away overnight to a bed-and-breakfast
for \$200 per night. Kimberly has \$1,000 per year to spend between
these two choices. After thinking about her total utility and marginal
utility and applying the decision rule that the ratio of the marginal
utilities to the prices should be equal between the two products,
Kimberly chooses point M, with eight concerts and three overnight
getaways as her utility-maximizing choice.

![](media/6-2-how-changes-in-income-and-prices-affect-consumption-choices_rId23.jpeg){width="3.25in" height="2.535in"}

Figure 6.3 How a Change in Income Affects Consumption Choices The
utility-maximizing choice on the original budget constraint is M. The
dashed horizontal and vertical lines extending through point M allow you
to see at a glance whether the quantity consumed of goods on the new
budget constraint is higher or lower than on the original budget
constraint. On the new budget constraint, Kimberly will make a choice
like N if both goods are normal goods. If overnight stays is an inferior
good, Kimberly will make a choice like P. If concert tickets are an
inferior good, Kimberly will make a choice like Q.

Now, assume that the income Kimberly has to spend on these two items
rises to \$2,000 per year, causing her budget constraint to shift out to
the right. How does this rise in income alter her utility-maximizing
choice? Kimberly will again consider the utility and marginal utility
that she receives from concert tickets and overnight getaways and seek
her utility-maximizing choice on the new budget line, but how will her
new choice relate to her original choice?

We can replace the possible choices along the new budget constraint into
three groups, which the dashed horizontal and vertical lines that pass
through the original choice M in the figure divide. All choices on the
upper left of the new budget constraint that are to the left of the
vertical dashed line, like choice P with two overnight stays and 32
concert tickets, involve less of the good on the horizontal axis but
much more of the good on the vertical axis. All choices to the right of
the vertical dashed line and above the horizontal dashed line---like
choice N with five overnight getaways and 20 concert tickets---have more
consumption of both goods. Finally, all choices that are to the right of
the vertical dashed line but below the horizontal dashed line, like
choice Q with four concerts and nine overnight getaways, involve less of
the good on the vertical axis but much more of the good on the
horizontal axis.

All of these choices are theoretically possible, depending on Kimberly's
personal preferences as expressed through the total and marginal utility
she would receive from consuming these two goods. When income rises, the
most common reaction is to purchase more of both goods, like choice N,
which is to the upper right relative to Kimberly's original choice M,
although exactly how much more of each good will vary according to
personal taste. Conversely, when income falls, the most typical reaction
is to purchase less of both goods. As we defined in the chapter on
[Demand and
Supply](http://openstax.org/books/principles-microeconomics-3e/pages/3-introduction-to-demand-and-supply)
and again in the chapter on
[Elasticity](http://openstax.org/books/principles-microeconomics-3e/pages/5-introduction-to-elasticity),
we call goods and services normal goods when a rise in income leads to a
rise in the quantity consumed of that good and a fall in income leads to
a fall in quantity consumed.

However, depending on Kimberly's preferences, a rise in income could
cause consumption of one good to increase while consumption of the other
good declines. A choice like P means that a rise in income caused her
quantity consumed of overnight stays to decline, while a choice like Q
would mean that a rise in income caused her quantity of concerts to
decline. Goods where demand declines as income rises (or conversely,
where the demand rises as income falls) are called "inferior goods." An
inferior good occurs when people trim back on a good as income rises,
because they can now afford the more expensive choices that they prefer.
For example, a higher-income household might eat fewer hamburgers or be
less likely to buy a used car, and instead eat more steak and buy a new
car.

#### How Price Changes Affect Consumer Choices

For analyzing the possible effect of a change in price on consumption,
let's again use a concrete example. [Figure 6.4](#CNX_Econ_C06_003)
represents Sergei\'s consumer choice, who chooses between purchasing
baseball bats and cameras. A price increase for baseball bats would have
no effect on the ability to purchase cameras, but it would reduce the
number of bats Sergei could afford to buy. Thus a price increase for
baseball bats, the good on the horizontal axis, causes the budget
constraint to rotate inward, as if on a hinge, from the vertical axis.
As in the previous section, the point labeled M represents the
originally preferred point on the original budget constraint, which
Sergei has chosen after contemplating his total utility and marginal
utility and the tradeoffs involved along the budget constraint. In this
example, the units along the horizontal and vertical axes are not
numbered, so the discussion must focus on whether Sergei will consume
more or less of certain goods, not on numerical amounts.

![](media/6-2-how-changes-in-income-and-prices-affect-consumption-choices_rId33.jpeg){width="4.88in" height="2.295in"}

Figure 6.4 How a Change in Price Affects Consumption Choices The
original utility-maximizing choice is M. When the price rises, the
budget constraint rotates clockwise. The dashed lines make it possible
to see at a glance whether the new consumption choice involves less of
both goods, or less of one good and more of the other. The new possible
choices would be fewer baseball bats and more cameras, like point H, or
less of both goods, as at point J. Choice K would mean that the higher
price of bats led to exactly the same quantity of bat consumption, but
fewer cameras. Theoretically possible, but unlikely in the real world,
we rule out choices like L because they would mean that a higher price
for baseball bats means a greater consumption of baseball bats.

After the price increase, Sergei will make a choice along the new budget
constraint. Again, we can divide his choices into three segments by the
dashed vertical and horizontal lines. In the upper left portion of the
new budget constraint, at a choice like H, Sergei consumes more cameras
and fewer bats. In the central portion of the new budget constraint, at
a choice like J, he consumes less of both goods. At the right-hand end,
at a choice like L, he consumes more bats but fewer cameras.

The typical response to higher prices is that a person chooses to
consume less of the product with the higher price. This occurs for two
reasons, and both effects can occur simultaneously. The substitution
effect occurs when a price changes and consumers have an incentive to
consume less of the good with a relatively higher price and more of the
good with a relatively lower price. The income effect is that a higher
price means, in effect, the buying power of income has been reduced
(even though actual income has not changed), which leads to buying less
of the good (when the good is normal). In this example, the higher price
for baseball bats would cause Sergei to buy fewer bats for both reasons.
Exactly how much will a higher price for bats cause Sergei\'s bat
consumption to fall? [Figure 6.4](#CNX_Econ_C06_003) suggests a range of
possibilities. Sergei might react to a higher price for baseball bats by
purchasing the same quantity of bats, but cutting his camera
consumption. This choice is the point K on the new budget constraint,
straight below the original choice M. Alternatively, Sergei might react
by dramatically reducing his bat purchases and instead buy more cameras.

The key is that it would be imprudent to assume that a change in the
price of one good will only affect consumption of that good. In our
example, since Sergei purchases all his products out of the same budget,
a change in the price of baseball bats can also have a range of effects,
either positive or negative, on his purchases of cameras. Since Sergei
purchases all his products out of the same budget, a change in the price
of one good can also have a range of effects, either positive or
negative, on the quantity consumed of other goods.

In short, a higher price typically causes reduced consumption of the
good in question, but it can affect the consumption of other goods as
well.

#### The Foundations of Demand Curves

Changes in the price of a good lead the budget constraint to rotate. A
rotation in the budget constraint means that when individuals are
seeking their highest utility, the quantity that is demanded of that
good will change. In this way, the logical foundations of demand
curves---which show a connection between prices and quantity
demanded---are based on the underlying idea of individuals seeking
utility. [Figure 6.5](#CNX_Econ_C06_004) (a) shows a budget constraint
with a choice between housing and "everything else." (Putting
"everything else" on the vertical axis can be a useful approach in some
cases, especially when the focus of the analysis is on one particular
good.) We label the preferred choice on the original budget constraint
that provides the highest possible utility M~0~. The other three budget
constraints represent successively higher prices for housing of P~1~,
P~2~, and P~3~. As the budget constraint rotates in, and in, and in
again, we label the utility-maximizing choices M~1~, M~2~, and M~3~, and
the quantity demanded of housing falls from Q~0~ to Q~1~ to Q~2~ to
Q~3~.

![](media/6-2-how-changes-in-income-and-prices-affect-consumption-choices_rId42.jpeg){width="3.25in" height="5.085in"}

Figure 6.5 The Foundations of a Demand Curve: An Example of Housing (a)
As the price increases from P~0~ to P~1~ to P~2~ to P~3~, the budget
constraint on the upper part of the diagram rotates clockwise. The
utility-maximizing choice changes from M~0~ to M~1~ to M~2~ to M~3~. As
a result, the quantity demanded of housing shifts from Q~0~ to Q~1~ to
Q~2~ to Q~3~, *ceteris paribus*. (b) The demand curve graphs each
combination of the price of housing and the quantity of housing
demanded, *ceteris paribus*. The quantities of housing are the same at
the points on both (a) and (b). Thus, the original price of housing
(P~0~) and the original quantity of housing (Q~0~) appear on the demand
curve as point E~0~. The higher price of housing (P~1~) and the
corresponding lower quantity demanded of housing (Q~1~) appear on the
demand curve as point E~1~.

Thus, as the price of housing rises, the budget constraint rotates
clockwise and the quantity consumed of housing falls, *ceteris paribus*
(meaning, with all other things being the same). We graph this
relationship---the price of housing rising from P~0~ to P~1~ to P~2~ to
P~3~, while the quantity of housing demanded falls from Q~0~ to Q~1~ to
Q~2~ to Q~3~---on the demand curve in [Figure 6.5](#CNX_Econ_C06_004)
(b). The vertical dashed lines stretching between the top and bottom of
[Figure 6.5](#CNX_Econ_C06_004) show that the quantity of housing
demanded at each point is the same in both (a) and (b). We ultimately
determine the shape of a demand curve by the underlying choices about
maximizing utility subject to a budget constraint. While economists may
not be able to measure "utils," they can certainly measure price and
quantity demanded.

#### Applications in Government and Business

The budget constraint framework for making utility-maximizing choices
offers a reminder that people can react to a change in price or income
in a range of different ways. For example, in the winter months of 2005,
costs for heating homes increased significantly in many parts of the
country as prices for natural gas and electricity soared, due in large
part to the disruption caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Some
people reacted by reducing the quantity demanded of energy; for example,
by turning down the thermostats in their homes by a few degrees and
wearing a heavier sweater inside. Even so, many home heating bills rose,
so people adjusted their consumption in other ways, too. As you learned
in the chapter on
[Elasticity](http://openstax.org/books/principles-microeconomics-3e/pages/5-introduction-to-elasticity),
the short run demand for home heating is generally inelastic. Each
household cut back on what it valued least on the margin. For some it
might have been some dinners out, or a vacation, or postponing buying a
new refrigerator or a new car. Sharply higher energy prices can have
effects beyond the energy market, leading to a widespread reduction in
purchasing throughout the rest of the economy.

A similar issue arises when the government imposes taxes on certain
products, such as on gasoline, cigarettes, and alcohol. Say that a tax
on alcohol leads to a higher price at the liquor store. The higher price
of alcohol causes the budget constraint to pivot left, and alcoholic
beverage consumption is likely to decrease. However, people may also
react to the higher price of alcoholic beverages by cutting back on
other purchases. For example, they might cut back on snacks at
restaurants like chicken wings and nachos. It would be unwise to assume
that the liquor industry is the only one affected by the tax on
alcoholic beverages. Read the next Clear It Up to learn about how who
controls the household income influences buying decisions.

#### The Unifying Power of the Utility-Maximizing Budget Set Framework

An interaction between prices, budget constraints, and personal
preferences determine household choices. The flexible and powerful
terminology of utility-maximizing gives economists a vocabulary for
bringing these elements together.

Not even economists believe that people walk around mumbling about their
marginal utilities before they walk into a shopping mall, accept a job,
or make a deposit in a savings account. However, economists do believe
that individuals seek their own satisfaction or utility and that people
often decide to try a little less of one thing and a little more of
another. If we accept these assumptions, then the idea of
utility-maximizing households facing budget constraints becomes highly
plausible.

#### Clear It Up {#clear-it-up .Heading3Grey}

##### Does who controls household income make a difference? {#does-who-controls-household-income-make-a-difference .Heading4Grey}

In the mid-1970s, the United Kingdom made an interesting policy change
in its "child allowance" policy. This program provides a fixed amount of
money per child to every family, regardless of family income.
Traditionally, the child allowance had been distributed to families by
withholding less in taxes from the paycheck of the family wage
earner---typically the father in this time period. The new policy
instead provided the child allowance as a cash payment to the mother. As
a result of this change, households have the same level of income and
face the same prices in the market, but the money is more likely to be
in the mother\'s purse than in the father\'s wallet.

Should this change in policy alter household consumption patterns? Basic
models of consumption decisions, of the sort that we examined in this
chapter, assume that it does not matter which parent or guardian
receives the money, because both seek to maximize the family\'s utility
as a whole. In effect, this model assumes that everyone in the family
has the same makeup or has the same preferences.

There has not been extensive research on diverse family structures and
guardian/parent sex and gender related to spending. However, the older
research on families with one man and one woman parent indicates that
gender does affect spending decisions. When the mother controls a larger
share of family income a number of studies, in the United Kingdom and in
a wide variety of other countries, have found that the family tends to
spend more on restaurant meals, child care, and women's clothing, and
less on alcohol and tobacco. As the mother controls a larger share of
household resources, children's health improves, too. These findings
suggest that when providing assistance to families, in high-income
countries and low-income countries alike, the monetary amount of
assistance is not all that matters: it also matters which family member
actually receives the money.

The budget constraint framework serves as a constant reminder to think
about the full range of effects that can arise from changes in income or
price, not just effects on the one product that might seem most
immediately affected.


### 6.3 Behavioral Economics: An Alternative Framework for Consumer Choice

#### Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

-   Evaluate the reasons for making intertemporal choices
-   Interpret an intertemporal budget constraint
-   Analyze why people in America tend to save such a small percentage
    of their income

As we know, people sometimes make decisions that seem "irrational" and
not in their own best interest. People's decisions can seem inconsistent
from one day to the next and they even deliberately ignore ways to save
money or time. The traditional economic models assume rationality, which
means that people take all available information and make consistent and
informed decisions that are in their best interest. (In fact, economics
professors often delight in pointing out so-called "irrational behavior"
each semester to their new students, and present economics as a way to
become more rational.)

However, a new group of economists, known as behavioral economists,
argue that the traditional method omits something important: people's
state of mind. For example, one can think differently about money if one
is feeling revenge, optimism, or loss. These are not necessarily
irrational states of mind, but part of a range of emotions that can
affect anyone on a given day. In addition, actions under these
conditions are predictable, if one better understands the underlying
environment. Behavioral economics seeks to enrich our understanding of
decision-making by integrating the insights of psychology into
economics. It does this by investigating how given dollar amounts can
mean different things to individuals depending on the situation. This
can lead to decisions that appear outwardly inconsistent, or irrational,
to the outside observer.

The way the mind works, according to this view, may seem inconsistent to
traditional economists but is actually far more complex than an
unemotional cost-benefit adding machine. For example, a traditional
economist would say that if you lost a \$10 bill today, and also
received an extra \$10 in your paycheck, you should feel perfectly
neutral. After all, --\$10 + \$10 = \$0. You are the same financially as
you were before. However, behavioral economists have conducted research
that shows many people will feel some negative emotion, such as anger or
frustration, after those two things happen. We tend to focus more on the
loss than the gain. We call this loss aversion, where a \$1 loss pains
us 2.25 times more than a \$1 gain helps us, according to the economists
Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky in a famous 1979 article in the journal
*Econometrica*. This insight has implications for investing, as people
tend to "overplay" the stock market by reacting more to losses than to
gains. This behavior looks irrational to traditional economists, but is
consistent once we understand better how the mind works, these
economists argue.

Traditional economists also assume human beings have complete self
control, but, for instance, people will buy cigarettes by the pack
instead of the carton even though the carton saves them money, to keep
usage down. They purchase locks for their refrigerators and overpay on
taxes to force themselves to save. In other words, we protect ourselves
from our worst temptations but pay a price to do so. One way behavioral
economists are responding to this is by establishing ways for people to
keep themselves free of these temptations. This includes what we call
"nudges" toward more rational behavior rather than mandatory regulations
from government. For example, up to 20 percent of new employees do not
enroll in retirement savings plans immediately, because of
procrastination or feeling overwhelmed by the different choices. Some
companies are now moving to a new system, where employees are
automatically enrolled unless they "opt out." Almost no-one opts out in
this program and employees begin saving at the early years, which are
most critical for retirement.

Another area that seems illogical is the idea of mental accounting, or
putting dollars in different mental categories where they take different
values. Economists typically consider dollars to be fungible, or having
equal value to the individual, regardless of the situation.

You might, for instance, think of the \$25 you found in the street
differently from the \$25 you earned from three hours working in a fast
food restaurant. You might treat the street money as "mad money" with
little rational regard to getting the best value. This is in one sense
strange, since it is still equivalent to three hours of hard work in the
restaurant. Yet the "easy come-easy go" mentality replaces the rational
economizer because of the situation, or context, in which you attained
the money.

In another example of mental accounting that seems inconsistent to a
traditional economist, a person could carry a credit card debt of
\$1,000 that has a 15% yearly interest cost, and simultaneously have a
\$2,000 savings account that pays only 2% per year. That means she pays
\$150 a year to the credit card company, while collecting only \$40
annually in bank interest, so she loses \$110 a year. That doesn't seem
wise.

The "rational" decision would be to pay off the debt, since a \$1,000
savings account with \$0 in debt is the equivalent net worth, and she
would now net \$20 per year. Curiously, it is not uncommon for people to
ignore this advice, since they will treat a loss to their savings
account as higher than the benefit of paying off their credit card. They
do not treat the dollars as fungible so it looks irrational to
traditional economists.

Which view is right, the behavioral economists' or the traditional view?
Both have their advantages, but behavioral economists have at least
identified trying to describe and explain behavior that economists have
historically dismissed as irrational. If most of us are engaged in some
"irrational behavior," perhaps there are deeper underlying reasons for
this behavior in the first place.

#### Bring It Home {#bring-it-home .Heading3Grey}

##### Making Choices {#making-choices .Heading4Grey}

In what category did consumers worldwide increase their spending during
the Great Recession? Higher education. According to the United Nations
Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), enrollment
in colleges and universities rose one-third in China and almost
two-thirds in Saudi Arabia, nearly doubled in Pakistan, tripled in
Uganda, and surged by three million---18 percent---in the United States.
Why were consumers willing to spend on education during lean times? Both
individuals and countries view higher education as the way to
prosperity. Many feel that increased earnings are a significant benefit
of attending college.

U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data from May 2012 supports this view,
as [Figure 6.6](#CNX_Econ_C06_010) shows. They show a positive
correlation between earnings and education. The data also indicate that
unemployment rates fall with higher levels of education and training.

Why spend the money to go to college during recession? Because if you
are unemployed (or underemployed, working fewer hours than you would
like), the opportunity cost of your time is low. If you're unemployed,
you don't have to give up work hours and income by going to college.

#### Chapter Objectives {#chapter-objectives .Heading3Grey}

In this chapter, you will learn about:

-   Consumption Choices
-   How Changes in Income and Prices Affect Consumption Choices
-   How Consumer Choices Might Not Always be Rational

### Introduction to Consumer Choices

#### Bring It Home {#bring-it-home .Heading3Grey}

##### Making Choices {#making-choices .Heading4Grey}

The 2008--2009 Great Recession touched families around the globe. In too
many countries, workers found themselves out of a job. In developed
countries, unemployment compensation provided a safety net, but families
still saw a marked decrease in disposable income and had to make tough
spending decisions. Of course, non-essential, discretionary spending was
the first to go.

Even so, there was one particular category that saw a universal increase
in spending world-wide during that time---an 18% uptick in the United
States, specifically. You might guess that consumers began eating more
meals at home, increasing grocery store spending; however, the Bureau of
Labor Statistics' Consumer Expenditure Survey, which tracks U.S. food
spending over time, showed "real total food spending by U.S. households
declined five percent between 2006 and 2009." So, it was not groceries.
What product would people around the world demand more of during tough
economic times, and more importantly, why? (Find out at chapter's end.)

That question leads us to this chapter's topic---analyzing how consumers
make choices and how changes affect those choices. For instance, do
changes in prices matter more or less than changes in a consumer's
income? Can a small change in circumstances alter the consumers'
perception of a product or even of their own resources? While many
choices may seem straightforward, there is often much more to consider.

Microeconomics seeks to understand the behavior of individual economic
agents such as individuals and businesses. Economists believe that we
can analyze individuals' decisions, such as what goods and services to
buy, as choices we make within certain budget constraints. Generally,
consumers are trying to get the most for their limited budget. In
economic terms they are trying to maximize total utility, or
satisfaction, given their budget constraint.

Everyone has their own personal tastes and preferences. The French say:
*Chacun à son goût*, or "Each to his own taste." An old Latin saying
states, *De gustibus non est disputandum* or "There's no disputing about
taste." If people base their decisions on their own tastes and personal
preferences, however, then how can economists hope to analyze the
choices consumers make?

An economic explanation for why people make different choices begins
with accepting the proverbial wisdom that tastes are a matter of
personal preference. However, economists also believe that the choices
people make are influenced by their incomes, by the prices of goods and
services they consume, and by factors like where they live. This chapter
introduces the economic theory of how consumers make choices about what
goods and services to buy with their limited income.

The analysis in this chapter will build on the budget constraint that we
introduced in the [Choice in a World of
Scarcity](http://openstax.org/books/principles-microeconomics-3e/pages/2-introduction-to-choice-in-a-world-of-scarcity)
chapter. This chapter will also illustrate how economic theory provides
a tool to systematically look at the full range of possible consumption
choices to predict how consumption responds to changes in prices or
incomes. After reading this chapter, consult the appendix [Indifference
Curves](http://openstax.org/books/principles-microeconomics-3e/pages/b-indifference-curves)
to learn more about representing utility and choice through indifference
curves.
