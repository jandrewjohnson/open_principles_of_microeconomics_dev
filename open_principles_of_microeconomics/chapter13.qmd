Launched by NASA on September 5, 1977, Voyager I's primary mission was
to provide detailed images of Jupiter, Saturn, and their moons. It took
this photograph of Jupiter on its journey. In August of 2012, Voyager I
entered interstellar space---the first human-made object to do so---and
it is expected to send data and images back to earth until 2025. Such a
technological feat entails many economic principles. (Credit:

#### Bring It Home {#bring-it-home .Heading3Grey}

##### The Benefits of Voyager I Endure {#the-benefits-of-voyager-i-endure .Heading4Grey}

The rapid growth of technology has increased our ability to access and
process data, to navigate through a busy city, and to communicate with
friends on the other side of the globe. The research and development
efforts of citizens, scientists, firms, universities, and governments
have truly revolutionized the modern economy. To get a sense of how far
we have come in a short period of time, let's compare one of humankind's
greatest achievements to the smartphone.

In 1977 the United States launched Voyager I, a spacecraft originally
intended to reach Jupiter and Saturn, to send back photographs and other
cosmic measurements. Voyager I, however, kept going, and going---past
Jupiter and Saturn---right out of our solar system. At the time of its
launch, Voyager had some of the most sophisticated computing processing
power NASA could engineer (8,000 instructions per second), but today, we
Earthlings use handheld devices that can process 14 billion instructions
per second.

Still, the technology of today is a spillover product of the incredible
feats NASA accomplished over forty years ago. NASA research, for
instance, is responsible for the kidney dialysis and mammogram machines
that we use today. Research in new technologies not only produces
private benefits to the investing firm, or in this case to NASA, but it
also creates benefits for the broader society. In this way, new
knowledge often becomes what economists refer to as a public good. This
leads us to the topic of this chapter---technology, positive
externalities, public goods, and the role of government in encouraging
innovation and the social benefits that it provides.

As economist Mariana Mazzucato explores in her well-known work *The
Entrepreneurial State*, what makes a smartphone smart? What allows its
apps to help you navigate new towns while getting updates about your
home, all while your hands are on the steering wheel and your children
are in the back seat watching their shows? For starters, the internet,
cell tower networks, GPS, and voice activation. Each of these, and many
other technologies we rely on, were developed with intensive government
support. For example, GPS, which enables many cell phone functions
beyond the frequently used mapping and ride-sharing applications, was
developed by the U.S. Department of Defense over several generations of
satellite tracking and complex computer algorithm development. The U.S.
government still provides GPS for many of the world's users.

We do not often think of the government when we consider our leading
products and entrepreneurs. We think of Apple, Google, Lyft, Tesla,
Fitbit, and so on---creative innovators who built on the tools provided
by these government efforts, using them in transformative ways. We may
not think of the estimated \$19 billion per year that the U.S. spends to
maintain the GPS system, but we would certainly think of it if it
suddenly went away. (Beyond the impact on our daily lives, economists
estimate U.S. businesses alone would lose about \$1 billion per day
without GPS.)

Mazzucato is one of several prominent economists advocating for an
embrace of continued government-sponsored innovations in order to build
economic prosperity, reduce inequality, and manage ongoing challenges
such as drought, coastal changes, and extreme weather. She argues that
competitive, private sector markets are often resistant to the risks
involved with large-scale innovation, because failed experiments and
lack of uptake lead to massive corporate and personal losses.
Governments can take on riskier research and development projects.
Because government spending is fueled by taxpayers, and all innovation
leads to some level of employment change, these proposals are certainly
complex and challenging to implement.

This chapter deals with some of these issues: Will private companies be
willing to invest in new technology? In what ways does new technology
have positive externalities? What motivates inventors? What role should
government play in encouraging research and technology? Are there
certain types of goods that markets fail to provide efficiently, and
that only government can produce? What happens when consumption or
production of a product creates positive externalities? Why is it
unsurprising when we overuse a common resource, like marine fisheries?


### 13.1 Investments in Innovation

#### Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

-   Identify the positive externalities of new technology.
-   Explain the difference between private benefits and social benefits
    and give examples of each.
-   Calculate and analyze rates of return

Market competition can provide an incentive for discovering new
technology because a firm can earn higher profits by finding a way to
produce products more cheaply or to create products with characteristics
consumers want. As Gregory Lee, CEO of Samsung said, "Relentless pursuit
of new innovation is the key principle of our business and enables
consumers to discover a world of possibilities with technology." An
innovative firm knows that it will usually have a temporary edge over
its competitors and thus an ability to earn above-normal profits before
competitors can catch up.

In certain cases, however, competition can discourage new technology,
especially when other firms can quickly copy a new idea. Consider a
pharmaceutical firm deciding to develop a new drug. On average, it can
cost \$800 million and take more than a decade to discover a new drug,
perform the necessary safety tests, and bring the drug to market. If the
research and development (R&D) effort fails---and every R&D project has
some chance of failure---then the firm will suffer losses and could even
be driven out of business. If the project succeeds, then the firm's
competitors may figure out ways of adapting and copying the underlying
idea, but without having to pay the costs themselves. As a result, the
innovative company will bear the much higher costs of the R&D and will
enjoy at best only a small, temporary advantage over the competition.

Many inventors over the years have discovered that their inventions
brought them less profit than they might have reasonably expected.

-   Eli Whitney (1765--1825) invented the cotton gin, but then southern
    cotton planters built their own seed-separating devices with a few
    minor changes in Whitney's design. When Whitney sued, he found that
    the courts in southern states would not uphold his patent rights.
-   Thomas Edison (1847--1931) still holds the record for most patents
    granted to an individual. His first invention was an automatic vote
    counter, and despite the social benefits, he could not find a
    government that wanted to buy it.
-   Gordon Gould came up with the idea behind the laser in 1957. He put
    off applying for a patent and, by the time he did apply, other
    scientists had laser inventions of their own. A lengthy legal battle
    resulted, in which Gould spent \$100,000 on lawyers, before he
    eventually received a patent for the laser in 1977. Compared to the
    enormous social benefits of the laser, Gould received relatively
    little financial reward.
-   In 1936, Alan Turing delivered a paper titled, \"On Computable
    Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem,\" in which
    he presented the notion of a universal machine (later called the
    "Universal Turing Machine,\" and then the \"Turing machine\")
    capable of computing anything that is computable. The central
    concept of the modern computer was based on Turing's paper. Today
    scholars widely consider Turing as the father of theoretical
    computer science and artificial intelligence; however, the UK
    government prosecuted Turing in 1952 for engaging in same-sex sexual
    acts and gave him the choice of chemical castration or prison.
    Turing chose castration and died in 1954 from cyanide poisoning.

A variety of studies by economists have found that the original inventor
receives one-third to one-half of the total economic benefits from
innovations, while other businesses and new product users receive the
rest.

#### The Positive Externalities of New Technology

Will private firms in a market economy underinvest in research and
technology? If a firm builds a factory or buys a piece of equipment, the
firm receives all the economic benefits that result from the
investments. However, when a firm invests in new technology, the private
benefits, or profits, that the firm receives are only a portion of the
overall social benefits. The social benefits of an innovation account
for the value of all the positive externalities of the new idea or
product, whether enjoyed by other companies or society as a whole, as
well as the private benefits the firm that developed the new technology
receives. As you learned in @sec-chapter-12,
positive externalities are beneficial spillovers to a third party, or
parties.

Consider the example of the Big Drug Company, which is planning its R&D
budget for the next year. Economists and scientists working for Big Drug
have compiled a list of potential research and development projects and
estimated rates of return. (The rate of return is the estimated payoff
from the project.) [Figure 13.2](#fig-13_2) shows how the
calculations work. The downward-sloping D~Private~ curve represents the
firm's demand for financial capital and reflects the company's
willingness to borrow to finance research and development projects at
various interest rates. Suppose that this firm's investment in research
and development creates a spillover benefit to other firms and
households. After all, new innovations often spark other creative
endeavors that society also values. If we add the spillover benefits
society enjoys to the firm's private demand for financial capital, we
can draw D~Social~ that lies above D~Private~.

If there were a way for the firm to fully monopolize those social
benefits by somehow making them unavailable to the rest of us, the
firm's private demand curve would be the same as society's demand curve.
According to [Figure 13.2](#fig-13_2) and @tbl-table_13_1, if the going rate of interest on borrowing is
8%, and the company can receive the private benefits of innovation only,
then the company would finance \$30 million. Society, at the same rate
of 8%, would find it optimal to have \$52 million of borrowing. Unless
there is a way for the company to fully enjoy the total benefits, then
it will borrow less than the socially optimal level of \$52 million.

![](media/13-1-investments-in-innovation_rId30.jpeg){width="3.25in" height="2.265in" #fig-13_2}

Figure 13.2 Positive Externalities and Technology Big Drug faces a cost
of borrowing of 8%. If the firm receives only the private benefits of
investing in R&D, then we show its demand curve for financial capital by
D~Private~, and the equilibrium will occur at \$30 million. Because
there are spillover benefits, society would find it optimal to have \$52
million of investment. If the firm could keep the social benefits of its
investment for itself, its demand curve for financial capital would be
D~Social~ and it would be willing to borrow \$52 million.

| Rate of Return | DPrivate (in millions) | DSocial (in millions) |
|-----------------|-------------------------|------------------------|
| 2%              | $72                     | $84                    |
| 4%              | $52                     | $72                    |
| 6%              | $38                     | $62                    |
| 8%              | $30                     | $52                    |
| 10%             | $26                     | $44                    |

: Return and Demand for Capital {#tbl-table_13_1}

Big Drug's original demand for financial capital (D~Private~) is based
on the profits the firm receives. However, other pharmaceutical firms
and health care companies may learn new lessons about how to treat
certain medical conditions and are then able to create their own
competing products. The social benefit of the drug takes into account
the value of all the drug\'s positive externalities. If Big Drug were
able to gain this social return instead of other companies, its demand
for financial capital would shift to the demand curve D~Social~, and it
would be willing to borrow and invest \$52 million. However, if Big Drug
is receiving only 50 cents of each dollar of social benefits, the firm
will not spend as much on creating new products. The amount it would be
willing to spend would fall somewhere in between D~Private~ and
D~Social~.

#### Why Invest in Human Capital?

The investment in anything, whether it is the construction of a new
power plant or research in a new cancer treatment, usually requires a
certain upfront cost with an uncertain future benefit. The investment in
education, or human capital, is no different. Over the span of many
years, a student and her family invest significant amounts of time and
money into that student's education. The idea is that higher levels of
educational attainment will eventually serve to increase the student's
future productivity and subsequent ability to earn. Once the student
crunches the numbers, does this investment pay off for her?

Almost universally, economists have found that the answer to this
question is a clear "Yes." For example, several studies of the return to
education in the United States estimate that the rate of return to a
college education is approximately 10-15%. Data in @tbl-table_13_2, from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics'
*Usual Weekly Earnings of Wage and Salary Workers, Fourth Quarter 2021,*
demonstrate that median weekly earnings are higher for workers who have
completed more education. While these rates of return will beat
equivalent investments in Treasury bonds or savings accounts, the
estimated returns to education go primarily to the individual worker, so
these returns are private rates of return to education.

|                                        | Less than a High School Degree | High School Degree, No College | Bachelor's Degree or Higher |
|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Median Weekly Earnings (full-time workers over the age of 25) | $651                            | $831                           | $1,467                      |

: Usual Weekly Earnings of Wage and Salary Workers, Fourth
Quarter 2021 (Source: <https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/wkyeng.pdf>) {#tbl-table_13_2}

What does society gain from investing in the education of another
student? After all, if the government is spending taxpayer dollars to
subsidize public education, society should expect some kind of return on
that spending. Economists like George Psacharopoulos have found that,
across a variety of nations, the social rate of return on schooling is
also positive. After all, positive externalities exist from investment
in education. While not always easy to measure, according to Walter
McMahon, the positive externalities to education typically include
better health outcomes for the population, lower levels of crime, a
cleaner environment and a more stable, democratic government. For these
reasons, many nations have chosen to use taxpayer dollars to subsidize
primary, secondary, and higher education. Education clearly benefits the
person who receives it, but a society where most people have a good
level of education provides positive externalities for all.

#### Other Examples of Positive Externalities

Although technology may be the most prominent example of a positive
externality, it is not the only one. For example, vaccinations against
disease are not only a protection for the individual, but they have the
positive spillover of protecting others who may become infected. When a
number of homes in a neighborhood are modernized, updated, and restored,
not only does it increase the homes\' value, but other property values
in the neighborhood may increase as well.

The appropriate public policy response to a positive externality, like a
new technology, is to help the party creating the positive externality
receive a greater share of the social benefits. In the case of vaccines,
like flu shots, an effective policy might be to provide a subsidy to
those who choose to get vaccinated.

[Figure 13.3](#fig-13_3) shows the market for flu shots. The
market demand curve D~Market~ for flu shots reflects only the marginal
private benefits (MPB) that the vaccinated individuals receive from the
shots. Assuming that there are no spillover costs in the production of
flu shots, the market supply curve is given by the marginal private cost
(MPC) of producing the vaccinations.

The equilibrium quantity of flu shots produced in the market, where MPB
is equal to MPC, is Q~Market~ and the price of flu shots is P~Market~.
However, spillover benefits exist in this market because others, those
who chose not to purchase a flu shot, receive a positive externality in
the form of a reduced chance of contracting the flu. When we add the
spillover benefits to the marginal private benefit of flu shots, the
marginal social benefit (MSB) of flu shots is given by D~Social~.
Because the MSB is greater than MPB, we see that the socially optimal
level of flu shots is greater than the market quantity (Q~Social~
exceeds Q~Market~) and the corresponding price of flu shots, if the
market were to produce Q~Social~, would be at P~Social~. Unfortunately,
the marketplace does not recognize the positive externality and flu
shots will go under-produced and under-consumed.

How can government try to move the market level of output closer to the
socially desirable level of output? One policy would be to provide a
subsidy, like a voucher, to any citizen who wishes to get vaccinated.
This voucher would act as "income" that one could use to purchase only a
flu shot and, if the voucher were exactly equal to the per-unit
spillover benefits, would increase market equilibrium to a quantity of
Q~Social~ and a price of P~Social~ where MSB equals MSC (which equals
MPC given the assumption that there are no spillover costs in producing
the vaccine). Suppliers of the flu shots would receive payment of
P~Social~ per vaccination, while consumers of flu shots would redeem the
voucher and only pay a price of P~Subsidy~. When the government uses a
subsidy in this way, it produces the socially optimal quantity of
vaccinations.

![](media/13-1-investments-in-innovation_rId42.jpeg){width="4.88in" height="2.89in" #fig-13_3}

Figure 13.3 The Market for Flu Shots with Spillover Benefits (A Positive
Externality) The market demand curve does not reflect the positive
externality of flu vaccinations, so only Q~Market~ will be exchanged.
This outcome is inefficient because the marginal social benefit exceeds
the marginal social cost. If the government provides a subsidy to
consumers of flu shots, equal to the marginal social benefit minus the
marginal private benefit, the level of vaccinations can increase to the
socially optimal quantity of Q~Social~.

##### Societal Change as an Innovation Outcome

Economist Carlota Perez draws on the lessons of past innovations to
understand the current state of our economy. She demonstrates that prior
technological turning points, such as the proliferation of railroads and
the emergence of mass production, created initial periods of employment
and wealth shifting but eventually led to greater well-being and
economic growth. After difficult transition periods and sometimes
economic meltdowns during the "installment" phase of widespread new
technologies, many economies and the people within them have benefited
from prolonged periods of economic and lifestyle improvement, including
lower unemployment and better quality of life.

Most prior innovation periods, such as the Industrial Revolution, had
one significant downside: negative impacts on the environment, such as
pollution and habitat destruction. Perez notes that our current
revolution---in information and communications technology (ICT)---has
the potential for significant positive externalities related to the
environment. ICT is shifting many areas of society (and therefore
industry) to digital experiences and services that do not require fossil
fuels or similar natural resources. Vehicle sharing, product
rental-reuse networks, and new manufacturing methods offer the promise
of far less consumable consumption. And even though the appearance of
delivery trucks and shipping boxes gives the impression of environmental
damage, most studies indicate that online shopping is better for the
environment than individuals shopping in person. (This is partly
attributed to greater efficiency in a few trucks driving to a
neighborhood rather than everyone in the neighborhood driving to several
stores.) Consumers and governments can spur on those environmental
benefits by choosing or partnering with companies that focus on
furthering their environmental impact, such as by using solar power to
fuel their computer servers or by using electrically powered delivery
trucks.

Like other innovations, ICT has created some employment and economic
opportunities while it has reduced others. Increased globalization and
efficiencies have shuttered businesses and reduced wages in some areas.
Perez's research indicates that those types of employment shifts can be
managed through proper regulation and investment (especially in human
capital), particularly as firms in the relevant industries become mature
and profitable. The prospects aren't simple: ICT has created megafirms
like Amazon and Apple, which despite pleasing their consumers can wield
significant power over governments and employees. But on the
environmental and societal front at least, ICT has offered a wealth of
opportunities and externalities.


### 13.2 How Governments Can Encourage Innovation

#### Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

-   Explain the effects of intellectual property rights on social and
    private rates of return.
-   Identify three U.S. Government policies and explain how they
    encourage innovation

A number of different government policies can increase the incentives to
innovate, including: guaranteeing intellectual property rights,
government assistance with the costs of research and development, and
cooperative research ventures between universities and companies.

#### Intellectual Property Rights

One way to increase new technology is to guarantee the innovator an
exclusive right to that new product or process. Intellectual property
rights include patents, which give the inventor the exclusive legal
right to make, use, or sell the invention for a limited time, and
copyright laws, which give the author an exclusive legal right over
works of literature, music, film/video, and pictures. For example, if a
pharmaceutical firm has a patent on a new drug, then no other firm can
manufacture or sell that drug for 20 years, unless the firm with the
patent grants permission. Without a patent, the pharmaceutical firm
would have to face competition for any successful products, and could
earn no more than a normal rate of profit. With a patent, a firm is able
to earn monopoly profits on its product for a period of time---which
offers an incentive for research and development. In general, how long
can "a period of time" be? The Clear It Up discusses patent and
copyright protection timeframes for some works you might know.

#### Clear It Up {#clear-it-up .Heading3Grey}

##### How long is Mickey Mouse protected from being copied? {#how-long-is-mickey-mouse-protected-from-being-copied .Heading4Grey}

All patents and copyrights are scheduled to end someday. In 2003,
copyright protection for Mickey Mouse was scheduled to run out. Once the
copyright had expired, anyone would be able to copy Mickey Mouse
cartoons or draw and sell new ones. In 1998, however, Congress passed
the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act. For copyrights owned by
companies or other entities, it increased or extended the copyright from
75 years to 95 years after publication. For copyrights owned by
individuals, it increased or extended the copyright coverage from 50
years to 70 years after death. Along with protecting Mickey for another
20 years, the copyright extension affected about 400,000 books, movies,
and songs.

[Figure 13.4](#fig-13_4) illustrates how the total number of
patent applications filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, as
well as the total number of patents granted, surged in the mid-1990s
with the invention of the internet, and is still going strong today.

![](media/13-2-how-governments-can-encourage-innovation_rId25.jpeg){width="6.5in" height="2.59in" #fig-13_4}

Figure 13.4 Patents Filed and Granted, 1981--2012 The number of
applications filed for patents increased substantially beginning in the
1990s, due in part to the invention of the internet, which has led to
many other inventions and to the 1998 Copyright Term Extension Act.
(Source: http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/ido/oeip/taf/us_stat.htm)

While patents provide an incentive to innovate by protecting the
innovator, they are not perfect. For example:

-   In countries that already have patents, economic studies show that
    inventors receive only one-third to one-half of the total economic
    value of their inventions.
-   In a fast-moving high-technology industry like biotechnology or
    semiconductor design, patents may be almost irrelevant because
    technology is advancing so quickly.
-   Not every new idea can be protected with a patent or a
    copyright---for example, a new way of organizing a factory or a new
    way of training employees.
-   Patents may sometimes cover too much or be granted too easily. In
    the early 1970s, Xerox had received over 1,700 patents on various
    elements of the photocopy machine. Every time Xerox improved the
    photocopier, it received a patent on the improvement.
-   The 20-year time period for a patent is somewhat arbitrary. Ideally,
    a patent should cover a long enough period of time for the inventor
    to earn a good return, but not so long that it allows the inventor
    to charge a monopoly price permanently.

Because patents are imperfect and do not apply well to all situations,
alternative methods of improving the rate of return for inventors of new
technology are desirable. The following sections describe some of these
possible alternative policies.

#### Policy #1: Government Spending on Research and Development

If the private sector does not have sufficient incentive to carry out
research and development, one possibility is for the government to fund
such work directly. Government spending can provide direct financial
support for research and development (R&D) conducted at colleges and
universities, nonprofit research entities, and sometimes by private
firms, as well as at government-run laboratories. While government
spending on research and development produces technology that is broadly
available for firms to use, it costs taxpayers money and can sometimes
be directed more for political than for scientific or economic reasons.

#### Link It Up {#link-it-up .Heading3Grey}

Visit the NASA [website](https://www.nasa.gov/) and the USDA
[website](https://www.usda.gov/topics/conservation) to read about government research
that would not take place were it left to firms, due to the
externalities.

The first column of @tbl-table_13_3 shows the sources of
total U.S. spending on research and development. The second column shows
the total dollars of R&D funding by each source. The third column shows
that, relative to the total amount of funding, 22.7% comes from the
federal government, about 69% of R&D is done by industry, and less than
4% is done by universities and colleges. (The percentages below do not
add up to exactly 100% due to rounding.)

| Sources of R&D Funding         | Amount ($ billions) | Percent of the Total |
|-------------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|

: U.S. Research and Development Expenditures, 2018 (Source:
https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsf21324) {#tbl-table_13_3}

In the 1960s the federal government paid for about two-thirds of the
nation's R&D. Over time, the U.S. economy has come to rely much more
heavily on industry-funded R&D. The federal government has tried to
focus its direct R&D spending on areas where private firms are not as
active. One difficulty with direct government support of R&D is that it
inevitably involves political decisions about which projects are worthy.
The scientific question of whether research is worthwhile can easily
become entangled with considerations like the location of the
congressional district in which the research funding is spent.

#### Policy #2: Tax Breaks for Research and Development

A complementary approach to supporting R&D that does not involve the
government's close scrutiny of specific projects is to give firms a
reduction in taxes depending on how much research and development they
do. The federal government refers to this policy as the research and
experimentation (R&E) tax credit. According to the Treasury Department:
". . . the R&E Credit is also a cost-effective policy for stimulating
additional private sector investment. Most recent studies find that each
dollar of foregone tax revenue through the R&E Tax Credit causes firms
to invest at least a dollar in R&D, with some studies finding a benefit
to cost ratio of 2 or 2.96."

#### Policy #3 Cooperative Research

State and federal governments support research in a variety of ways. For
example, United for Medical Research, a coalition of groups that seek
funding for the National Institutes of Health, (which is supported by
federal grants), states: "NIH-supported research added \$69 billion to
our GDP and supported seven million jobs in 2011 alone." The United
States remains the leading sponsor of medical-related research, spending
\$117 billion in 2011. Other institutions, such as the National Academy
of Sciences and the National Academy of Engineering, receive federal
grants for innovative projects. The Agriculture and Food Research
Initiative (AFRI) at the United States Department of Agriculture awards
federal grants to projects that apply the best science to the most
important agricultural problems, from food safety to childhood obesity.
Cooperation between government-funded universities, academies, and the
private sector can spur product innovation and create whole new
industries.


### 13.3 Public Goods

#### Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

-   Identify a public good using nonexcludable and non-rival as criteria
-   Explain the free rider problem
-   Identify several sources of public goods

Even though new technology creates positive externalities so that
perhaps one-half or two-thirds of the social benefit of new inventions
spills over to others, the inventor still receives some private return.
What about a situation where the positive externalities are so extensive
that private firms could not expect to receive any of the social
benefit? We call this kind of good a public good. Spending on national
defense is a good example of a public good. Let's begin by defining the
characteristics of a public good and discussing why these
characteristics make it difficult for private firms to supply public
goods. Then we will see how government may step in to address the issue.

#### The Definition of a Public Good

Economists have a strict definition of a public good, and it does not
necessarily include all goods financed through taxes. To understand the
defining characteristics of a public good, first consider an ordinary
private good, like a piece of pizza. We can buy and sell a piece of
pizza fairly easily because it is a separate and identifiable item.
However, public goods are not separate and identifiable in this way.

Instead, public goods have two defining characteristics: they are
nonexcludable and non-rival. The first characteristic, that a public
good is nonexcludable, means that it is costly or impossible to exclude
someone from using the good. If Larry buys a private good like a piece
of pizza, then he can exclude others, like Lorna, from eating that
pizza. However, if national defense is provided, then it includes
everyone. Even if you strongly disagree with America's defense policies
or with the level of defense spending, the national defense still
protects you. You cannot choose to be unprotected, and national defense
cannot protect everyone else and exclude you.

The second main characteristic of a public good, that it is non-rival,
means that when one person uses the public good, another can also use
it. With a private good like pizza, if Max is eating the pizza then
Michelle cannot also eat it; that is, the two people are rivals in
consumption. With a public good like national defense, Max's consumption
of national defense does not reduce the amount left for Michelle, so
they are non-rival in this area.

A number of government services are examples of public goods. For
instance, it would not be easy to provide fire and police service so
that some people in a neighborhood would be protected from the burning
and burglary of their property, while others would not be protected at
all. Protecting some necessarily means protecting others, too.

Positive externalities and public goods are closely related concepts.
Public goods have positive externalities, like police protection or
public health funding. Not all goods and services with positive
externalities, however, are public goods. Investments in education have
huge positive spillovers but can be provided by a private company.
Private companies can invest in new inventions such as the Apple iPad
and reap profits that may not capture all of the social benefits. We can
also describe patents as an attempt to make new inventions into private
goods, which are excludable and rivalrous, so that no one but the
inventor can use them during the length of the patent.

#### The Free Rider Problem of Public Goods

Private companies find it difficult to produce public goods. If a good
or service is nonexcludable, like national defense, so that it is
impossible or very costly to exclude people from using this good or
service, then how can a firm charge people for it?

Visit this [website](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/the-decision-lab/201106/free-riders-and-why-bad-music-is-here-stay) to read about a
connection between free riders and "bad music."

When individuals make decisions about buying a public good, a free rider
problem can arise, in which people have an incentive to let others pay
for the public good and then to "free ride" on the purchases of others.
We can express the free rider problem in terms of the prisoner's dilemma
game, which we discussed as a representation of oligopoly in
@sec-chapter-10.

There is a dilemma with the Prisoner's Dilemma, though. See the Work It
Out feature.

#### Work It Out {#work-it-out .Heading3Grey}

##### The Problem with the Prisoner's Dilemma {#the-problem-with-the-prisoners-dilemma .Heading4Grey}

Suppose two people, Rachel and Samuel, are considering purchasing a
public good. The difficulty with the prisoner's dilemma arises as each
person thinks through their strategic choices.

Step 1. Rachel reasons in this way: If Samuel does not contribute, then
I would be a fool to contribute. However, if Samuel does contribute,
then I can come out ahead by not contributing.

Step 2. Either way, I should choose not to contribute, and instead hope
that I can be a free rider who uses the public good paid for by Samuel.

Step 3. Samuel reasons the same way about Rachel.

Step 4. When both people reason in that way, the public good never gets
built, and there is no movement to the option where everyone
cooperates---which is actually best for all parties.

#### The Role of Government in Paying for Public Goods

The key insight in paying for public goods is to find a way of assuring
that everyone will make a contribution and to prevent free riders. For
example, if people come together through the political process and agree
to pay taxes and make group decisions about the quantity of public
goods, they can defeat the free rider problem by requiring, through the
law, that everyone contributes.

However, government spending and taxes are not the only way to provide
public goods. In some cases, markets can produce public goods. For
example, think about radio. It is nonexcludable, since once the radio
signal is broadcast, it would be very difficult to stop someone from
receiving it. It is non-rival, since one person listening to the signal
does not prevent others from listening as well. Because of these
features, it is practically impossible to charge listeners directly for
listening to conventional radio broadcasts.

Radio has found a way to collect revenue by selling advertising, which
is an indirect way of "charging" listeners by taking up some of their
time. Ultimately, consumers who purchase the goods advertised are also
paying for the radio service, since the station builds in the cost of
advertising into the product cost. In a more recent development,
satellite radio companies, such as SiriusXM, charge a regular
subscription fee for streaming music without commercials. In this case,
however, the product is excludable---only those who pay for the
subscription will receive the broadcast.

Some public goods will also have a mixture of public provision at no
charge along with fees for some purposes, like a public city park that
is free to use, but the government charges a fee for parking your car,
for reserving certain picnic grounds, and for food sold at a refreshment
stand.

Read this [article](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2010/12/10/131784161/what-should-the-government-pay-for-autopsies-lighthouses) to find out
what economists say the government should pay for.

In other cases, we can use social pressures and personal appeals, rather
than the force of law, to reduce the number of free riders and to
collect resources for the public good. For example, neighbors sometimes
form an association to carry out beautification projects or to patrol
their area after dark to discourage crime. In low-income countries,
where social pressure strongly encourages all farmers to participate,
farmers in a region may come together to work on a large irrigation
project that will benefit all. We can view many fundraising efforts,
including raising money for local charities and for the endowments of
colleges and universities, as an attempt to use social pressure to
discourage free riding and to generate the outcome that will produce a
public benefit.

#### Common Resources and the "Tragedy of the Commons"

There are some goods that do not fall neatly into the categories of
private good or public good. While it is easy to classify a pizza as a
private good and a city park as a public good, what about an item that
is nonexcludable and rivalrous, such as the queen conch?

In the Caribbean, the queen conch is a large marine mollusk that lives
in shallow waters of sea grass. These waters are so shallow, and so
clear, that a single diver may harvest many conch in a single day. Not
only is conch meat a local delicacy and an important part of the local
diet, but artists use the large ornate shells and craftsmen transform
them. Because almost anyone with a small boat, snorkel, and mask, can
participate in the conch harvest, it is essentially nonexcludable. At
the same time, fishing for conch is rivalrous. Once a diver catches one
conch another diver cannot catch it.

We call goods that are nonexcludable and rivalrous common resources.
Because the waters of the Caribbean are open to all conch fishermen, and
because any conch that *you* catch is a conch that *I* cannot catch,
fishermen tend to overharvest common resources like the conch.

The problem of overharvesting common resources is not a new one, but
ecologist Garret Hardin put the tag "tragedy of the commons" to the
problem in a 1968 article in the magazine *Science*. Economists view
this as a problem of property rights. Since nobody owns the ocean, or
the conch that crawl on the sand beneath it, no one individual has an
incentive to protect that resource and responsibly harvest it. To
address the issue of overharvesting conch and other marine fisheries,
economists have advocated simple devices like fishing licenses, harvest
limits, and shorter fishing seasons. One approach that has been turned
to more recently is the implementation of catch shares, whereby
regulators establish a total allowable catch, and then fishermen are
allocated a portion of that total allowable catch. Catch shares appear
to slow the race to fish. When the population of a species drops to
critically low numbers, governments have even banned the harvest until
biologists determine that the population has returned to sustainable
levels. In fact, such is the case with the conch, the harvesting of
which the government has effectively banned in the United States since
1986.

The tragedy of the commons is a frequent economic and social framework
for discussions about a range of common resources, even extending into
digital resources such as open media repositories and online libraries.
Prominent economist Elinor Ostrom, the first woman to receive the Nobel
Prize in Economics, proposed an alternate version, sometimes referred to
as the \"non-tragedy of the commons.\" After extensive fieldwork in
areas as diverse as Indonesia, Kenya, Maine (U.S.), and Nepal, she
challenged the notion that people would only avoid depletion of common
resources if they were forced to by regulatory laws and property rights.
She noted that farmers working shared land could communicate and
cooperate in order to maximize and preserve the fields over time. She
argued that when those who benefit most from a resource are in close
proximity to it (like a farm field that directly serves a town), the
resource is better managed without external influence.

#### Positive Externalities in Public Health Programs

One of the most remarkable changes in the standard of living in the last
several centuries is that people are living longer. Scientists believe
that, thousands of years ago, human life expectancy ranged between 20 to
30 years. By 1900, average life expectancy in the United States was 47
years. By 2015, life expectancy was 79 years; due to COVID-19, life
expectancy declined slightly to 77 years in 2020. Most of the gains in
life expectancy in the history of the human race happened in the
twentieth century.

The rise in life expectancy seems to stem from three primary factors.
First, systems for providing clean water and disposing of human waste
helped to prevent the transmission of many diseases. Second, changes in
public behavior have advanced health. Early in the twentieth century,
for example, people learned the importance of boiling bottles before
using them for food storage and baby's milk, washing their hands, and
protecting food from flies. More recent behavioral changes include
reducing the number of people who smoke tobacco and precautions to limit
sexually transmitted diseases. Third, medicine has played a large role.
Scientists developed immunizations for diphtheria, cholera, pertussis,
tuberculosis, tetanus, and yellow fever between 1890 and 1930.
Penicillin, discovered in 1941, led to a series of other antibiotic
drugs for bringing infectious diseases under control. In recent decades,
drugs that reduce the risks of high blood pressure have had a dramatic
effect in extending lives.

These advances in public health have all been closely linked to positive
externalities and public goods. Public health officials taught hygienic
practices to mothers in the early 1900s and encouraged less smoking in
the late 1900s. Government funded many public sanitation systems and
storm sewers because they have the key traits of public goods. In the
twentieth century, many medical discoveries emerged from government or
university-funded research. Patents and intellectual property rights
provided an additional incentive for private inventors. The reason for
requiring immunizations, phrased in economic terms, is that it prevents
spillovers of illness to others---as well as helping the person
immunized.

##### The Benefits of Voyager I Endure {#the-benefits-of-voyager-i-endure .Heading4Grey}

While we applaud the technology spillovers of NASA's space projects, we
should also acknowledge that those benefits are not shared equally.
Economists like Tyler Cowen, a professor at George Mason University, are
seeing increasing evidence of a widening gap between those who have
access to rapidly improving technology, and those who do not. According
to Cowen, author of the 2013 book, *Average Is Over: Powering America
Beyond the Age of the Great Stagnation*, this inequality in access to
technology and information is going to deepen the inequality in skills,
and ultimately, in wages and global standards of living.
