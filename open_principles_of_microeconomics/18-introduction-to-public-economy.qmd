some are made in the United States and others are not. Those that are
not could be subject to a tariff that could cause the cost of all tires
to be higher. (Credit: \"Tires\" by Jayme del Rosario/Flickr Creative

#### Chinese Tire Tariffs {#chinese-tire-tariffs .Heading4Grey}

Do you know where the tires on your car are made? If they were imported,
they may be subject to a tariff (a tax on imported goods) that could
raise the price of your car. What do you think about that tariff? Would
you write to your representative or your senator about it? Would you
start a Facebook or Twitter campaign?

Most people are unlikely to fight this kind of tax or even inform
themselves about the issue in the first place. In *The Logic of
Collective Action* (1965), economist Mancur Olson challenged the popular
idea that, in a democracy, the majority view will prevail, and in doing
so launched the modern study of public economy, sometimes referred to as
public choice, a subtopic of microeconomics. In this chapter, we will
look at the economics of government policy, why smaller, more organized
groups have an incentive to work hard to enact certain policies, and why
lawmakers ultimately make decisions that may result in bad economic
policy.

As President Abraham Lincoln famously said in his 1863 *Gettysburg
Address*, democratic governments are supposed to be "of the people, by
the people, and for the people." Can we rely on democratic governments
to enact sensible economic policies? After all, they react to voters,
not to analyses of demand and supply curves. The main focus of an
economics course is, naturally enough, to analyze the characteristics of
markets and purely economic institutions. However, political
institutions also play a role in allocating society's scarce resources,
and economists have played an active role, along with other social
scientists, in analyzing how such political institutions work.

Other chapters of this book discuss situations in which market forces
can sometimes lead to undesirable results: monopoly, imperfect
competition, and antitrust policy; negative and positive externalities;
poverty and inequality of incomes; failures to provide insurance; and
financial markets that may go from boom to bust. Many of these chapters
suggest that the government\'s economic policies could address these
issues.

However, just as markets can face issues and problems that lead to
undesirable outcomes, a democratic system of government can also make
mistakes, either by enacting policies that do not benefit society as a
whole or by failing to enact policies that would have benefited society
as a whole. This chapter discusses some practical difficulties of
democracy from an economic point of view: we presume the actors in the
political system follow their own self-interest, which is not
necessarily the same as the public good. For example, many of those who
are eligible to vote do not, which obviously raises questions about
whether a democratic system will reflect everyone's interests. Benefits
or costs of government action are sometimes concentrated on small
groups, which in some cases may organize and have a disproportionately
large impact on politics and in other cases may fail to organize and end
up neglected. A legislator who worries about support from voters in
their district may focus on spending projects specific to the district
without sufficient concern for whether this spending is in the nation\'s
interest.

When more than two choices exist, the principle that the majority of
voters should decide may not always make logical sense, because
situations can arise where it becomes literally impossible to decide
what the "majority" prefers. Government may also be slower than private
firms to correct its mistakes, because government agencies do not face
competition or the threat of new entry.
