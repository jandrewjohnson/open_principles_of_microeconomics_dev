## 18.2 Special Interest Politics

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

-   Explain how special interest groups and lobbyists can influence
    campaigns and elections
-   Describe pork-barrel spending and logrolling

Many political issues are of intense interest to a relatively small
group, as we noted above. For example, many U.S. drivers do not much
care where their car tires were made---they just want good quality as
inexpensively as possible. In September 2009, President Obama and
Congress enacted a tariff (taxes added on imported goods) on tires
imported from China that would increase the price by 35 percent in its
first year, 30 percent in its second year, and 25 percent in its third
year. Interestingly, the U.S. companies that make tires did not favor
this step, because most of them also import tires from China and other
countries. (See [Globalization and
Protectionism](http://openstax.org/books/principles-microeconomics-3e/pages/20-introduction-to-globalization-and-protectionism)
for more on tariffs.) However, the United Steelworkers union, which had
seen jobs in the tire industry fall by 5,000 over the previous five
years, lobbied fiercely for the tariff. With this tariff, the cost of
all tires increased significantly. (See the closing Bring It Home
feature at the end of this chapter for more information on the tire
tariff.)

Special interest groups are groups that are small in number relative to
the nation, but quite well organized and focused on a specific issue. A
special interest group can pressure legislators to enact public policies
that do not benefit society as a whole. Imagine an environmental rule to
reduce air pollution that will cost 10 large companies \$8 million each,
for a total cost of \$80 million. The social benefits from enacting this
rule provide an average benefit of \$10 for every person in the United
States, for a total of about \$3 trillion. Even though the benefits are
far higher than the costs for society as a whole, the 10 companies are
likely to lobby much more fiercely to avoid \$8 million in costs than
the average person is to argue for \$10 worth of benefits.

As this example suggests, we can relate the problem of special interests
in politics to an issue we raised in [Environmental Protection and
Negative
Externalities](http://openstax.org/books/principles-microeconomics-3e/pages/12-introduction-to-environmental-protection-and-negative-externalities)
about economic policy with respect to negative externalities and
pollution---the problem called regulatory capture (which we defined in
[Monopoly and Antitrust
Policy](http://openstax.org/books/principles-microeconomics-3e/pages/11-introduction-to-monopoly-and-antitrust-policy)).
In legislative bodies and agencies that write laws and regulations about
how much corporations will pay in taxes, or rules for safety in the
workplace, or instructions on how to satisfy environmental regulations,
you can be sure the specific industry affected has lobbyists who study
every word and every comma. They talk with the legislators who are
writing the legislation and suggest alternative wording. They contribute
to the campaigns of legislators on the key committees---and may even
offer those legislators high-paying jobs after they have left office. As
a result, it often turns out that those regulated can exercise
considerable influence over the regulators.

lobbying.

In the early 2000s, about 40 million people in the United States were
eligible for Medicare, a government program that provides health
insurance for those 65 and older. On some issues, the elderly are a
powerful interest group. They donate money and time to political
campaigns, and in the 2020 presidential election, 76% of those ages
65--74 voted, while just 51% of those aged 18 to 24 cast a ballot,
according to the U.S. Census.

In 2003, Congress passed and President George Bush signed into law a
substantial expansion of Medicare that helped the elderly to pay for
prescription drugs. The prescription drug benefit cost the federal
government about \$40 billion in 2006, and the Medicare system projected
that the annual cost would rise to \$121 billion by 2016. The political
pressure to pass a prescription drug benefit for Medicare was apparently
quite high, while the political pressure to assist the 40 million with
no health insurance at all was considerably lower. One reason might be
that the American Association for Retired People AARP, a well-funded and
well-organized lobbying group represents senior citizens, while there is
no umbrella organization to lobby for those without health insurance.

In the battle over passage of the 2010 Affordable Care Act (ACA), which
became known as "Obamacare," there was heavy lobbying on all sides by
insurance companies and pharmaceutical companies. However, labor unions
and community groups financed a lobby group, Health Care for America Now
(HCAN), to offset corporate lobbying. HCAN, spending \$60 million
dollars, was successful in helping pass legislation which added new
regulations on insurance companies and a mandate that all individuals
will obtain health insurance by 2014. The following Work It Out feature
further explains voter incentives and lobbyist influence.

### Work It Out {#work-it-out .Heading3Grey}

#### Paying To Get Your Way {#paying-to-get-your-way .Heading4Grey}

Suppose Congress proposes a tax on carbon emissions for certain
factories in a small town of 10,000 people. Congress estimates the tax
will reduce pollution to such an extent that it will benefit each
resident by an equivalent of \$300. The tax will also reduce profits to
the town's two large factories by \$1 million each. How much should the
factory owners be willing to spend to fight the tax passage, and how
much should the townspeople be willing to pay to support it? Why is
society unlikely to achieve the optimal outcome?

Step 1. The two factory owners each stand to lose \$1 million if the tax
passes, so each should be willing to spend up to that amount to prevent
the passage, a combined sum of \$2 million. Of course, in the real
world, there is no guarantee that lobbying efforts will be successful,
so the factory owners may choose to invest an amount that is
substantially lower.

Step 2. There are 10,000 townspeople, each standing to benefit by \$300
if the tax passes. Theoretically, then, they should be willing to spend
up to \$3 million (10,000 Ã— \$300) to ensure passage. (Again, in the
real world with no guarantees of success, they may choose to spend
less.)

Step 3. It is costly and difficult for 10,000 people to coordinate in
such a way as to influence public policy. Since each person stands to
gain only \$300, many may feel lobbying is not worth the effort.

Step 4. The two factory owners, however, find it very easy and
profitable to coordinate their activities, so they have a greater
incentive to do so.

Special interests may develop a close relationship with one political
party, so their ability to influence legislation rises and falls as that
party moves in or out of power. A special interest may even hurt a
political party if it appears to a number of voters that the
relationship is too cozy. In a close election, a small group that has
been under-represented in the past may find that it can tip the election
one way or another---so that group will suddenly receive considerable
attention. Democratic institutions produce an ebb and flow of political
parties and interests and thus offer both opportunities for special
interests and ways of counterbalancing those interests over time.

### Identifiable Winners, Anonymous Losers

A number of economic policies produce gains whose beneficiaries are
easily identifiable, but costs that are partly or entirely shared by a
large number who remain anonymous. A democratic political system
probably has a bias toward those who are identifiable.

For example, policies that impose price controls---like rent
control---may look as if they benefit renters and impose costs only on
landlords. However, when landlords then decide to reduce the number of
rental units available in the area, a number of people who would have
liked to rent an apartment end up living somewhere else because no units
were available. These would-be renters have experienced a cost of rent
control, but it is hard to identify who they are.

Similarly, policies that block imports will benefit the firms that would
have competed with those imports---and workers at those firms---who are
likely to be quite visible. Consumers who would have preferred to
purchase the imported products, and who thus bear some costs of the
protectionist policy, are much less visible.

Specific tax breaks and spending programs also have identifiable winners
and impose costs on others who are hard to identify. Special interests
are more likely to arise from a group that is easily identifiable,
rather than from a group where some of those who suffer may not even
recognize they are bearing costs.

### Pork Barrels and Logrolling

Politicians have an incentive to ensure that they spend government money
in their home state or district, where it will benefit their
constituents in a direct and obvious way. Thus, when legislators are
negotiating over whether to support a piece of legislation, they
commonly ask each other to include pork-barrel spending, legislation
that benefits mainly a single political district. Pork-barrel spending
is another case in which concentrated benefits and widely dispersed
costs challenge democracy: the benefits of pork-barrel spending are
obvious and direct to local voters, while the costs are spread over the
entire country. Read the following Clear It Up feature for more
information on pork-barrel spending.

### Clear It Up {#clear-it-up .Heading3Grey}

#### How much impact can pork-barrel spending have? {#how-much-impact-can-pork-barrel-spending-have .Heading4Grey}

Many observers widely regard U.S. Senator Robert C. Byrd of West
Virginia, who was originally elected to the Senate in 1958 and served
until 2010, as one of the masters of pork-barrel politics, directing a
steady stream of federal funds to his home state. A journalist once
compiled a list of structures in West Virginia at least partly
government funded and named after Byrd: "the Robert C. Byrd Highway; the
Robert C. Byrd Locks and Dam; the Robert C. Byrd Institute; the Robert
C. Byrd Life Long Learning Center; the Robert C. Byrd Honors Scholarship
Program; the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope; the Robert C. Byrd
Institute for Advanced Flexible Manufacturing; the Robert C. Byrd
Federal Courthouse; the Robert C. Byrd Health Sciences Center; the
Robert C. Byrd Academic and Technology Center; the Robert C. Byrd United
Technical Center; the Robert C. Byrd Federal Building; the Robert C.
Byrd Drive; the Robert C. Byrd Hilltop Office Complex; the Robert C.
Byrd Library; and the Robert C. Byrd Learning Resource Center; the
Robert C. Byrd Rural Health Center." This list does not include
government-funded projects in West Virginia that were not named after
Byrd. Of course, we would have to analyze each of these expenditures in
detail to figure out whether we should treat them as pork-barrel
spending or whether they provide widespread benefits that reach beyond
West Virginia. At least some of them, or a portion of them, certainly
would fall into that category. Because there are currently no term
limits for Congressional representatives, those who have been in office
longer generally have more power to enact pork-barrel projects.

The amount that government spends on individual pork-barrel projects is
small, but many small projects can add up to a substantial total. A
nonprofit watchdog organization, called Citizens against Government
Waste, produces an annual report, the *Pig Book* that attempts to
quantify the amount of pork-barrel spending, focusing on items that only
one member of Congress requested, that were passed into law without any
public hearings, or that serve only a local purpose. Whether any
specific item qualifies as pork can be controversial. The 2021
Congressional Pig Book identified 285 earmarks in FY 2021, with a cost
of \$16.8 billion. Recent growth in earmarks and their cost is apparent:
in FY 2017, there were 163 earmarks at a cost of \$6.8 billion. Hence,
in only four years, there was a 75% increase in the number of earmarks
and a 147% increase in the cost of those earmarks.

Logrolling, an action in which all members of a group of legislators
agree to vote for a package of otherwise unrelated laws that they
individually favor, can encourage pork barrel spending. For example, if
one member of the U.S. Congress suggests building a new bridge or
hospital in their own congressional district, the other members might
oppose it. However, if 51% of the legislators come together, they can
pass a bill that includes a bridge or hospital for every one of their
districts.

As a reflection of this interest of legislators in their own districts,
the U.S. government has typically spread out its spending on military
bases and weapons programs to congressional districts all across the
country. In part, the government does this to help create a situation
that encourages members of Congress to vote in support of defense
spending.
