#### Bring It Home {#bring-it-home .Heading3Grey}

##### What's the Downside of Protection? {#whats-the-downside-of-protection .Heading4Grey}

Governments are motivated to limit and alter market outcomes for
political or social ends. While governments can limit the rise in prices
of some products, they cannot control how much people want to buy or how
much firms are willing to sell. The laws of demand and supply still
hold. Trade policy is an example where regulations can redirect economic
forces, but it cannot stop them from manifesting themselves elsewhere.

Flat-panel displays, the displays for laptop computers, tablets, and
flat screen televisions, are an example of such an enduring principle.
In the early 1990s, the vast majority of flat-panel displays used in
U.S.-manufactured laptops were imported, primarily from Japan. The small
but politically powerful U.S. flat-panel-display industry filed a
dumping complaint with the Commerce Department. They argued that
Japanese firms were selling displays at "less than fair value," which
made it difficult for U.S. firms to compete. This argument for trade
protection is referred to as anti-dumping. Other arguments for
protection in this complaint included national security. After a
preliminary determination by the Commerce Department that the Japanese
firms were dumping, the U.S. International Trade Commission imposed a
63% dumping margin (or tax) on the import of flat-panel displays. Was
this a successful exercise of U.S. trade policy? See what you think
after reading the chapter.

The world has become more connected on multiple levels, especially
economically. In 1970, imports and exports made up 11% of U.S. GDP,
while now they make up 32%. However, the United States, due to its size,
is less internationally connected than most countries. For example,
according to the World Bank, 97% of Botswana's economic activity is
connected to trade. This chapter explores trade policy---the laws and
strategies a country uses to regulate international trade. This topic is
not without controversy.

As the world has become more globally connected, firms and workers in
high-income countries like the United States, Japan, or the nations of
the European Union, perceive a competitive threat from firms in
medium-income countries like Mexico, China, or South Africa, that have
lower costs of living and therefore pay lower wages. Firms and workers
in low-income countries fear that they will suffer if they must compete
against more productive workers and advanced technology in high-income
countries.

On a different tack, some environmentalists worry that multinational
firms may evade environmental protection laws by moving their production
to countries with loose or nonexistent pollution standards, trading a
clean environment for jobs. Some politicians worry that their country
may become overly dependent on key imported products, like oil, which in
a time of war could threaten national security. All of these fears
influence governments to reach the same basic policy conclusion: to
protect national interests, whether businesses, jobs, or security,
imports of foreign products should be restricted. This chapter analyzes
such arguments. First, however, it is essential to learn a few key
concepts and understand how the demand and supply model applies to
international trade.


### 20.1 Protectionism: An Indirect Subsidy from Consumers to Producers

#### Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

-   Explain protectionism and its three main forms
-   Analyze protectionism through concepts of demand and supply, noting
    its effects on equilibrium
-   Calculate the effects of trade barriers

When a government legislates policies to reduce or block international
trade it is engaging in protectionism. Protectionist policies often seek
to shield domestic producers and domestic workers from foreign
competition. Protectionism takes three main forms: tariffs, import
quotas, and nontariff barriers.

Recall from @sec-chapter-19
that tariffs are taxes that governments impose on imported goods and
services. This makes imports more expensive for consumers, discouraging
imports. For example, in 2018, President Trump increased tariffs on
Chinese-manufactured goods by 2--25%, including TVs, monitors, desktop
PCs, smartwatches, and many other consumer goods. The intention behind
the policy was to shelter U.S. manufacturers from competition, helping
companies that operate domestically. China responded with tariffs on
American goods, launching a trade war. President Biden retained these
tariffs and considered additional ones, but as of August 2022, the
administration was considering changes designed to reduce inflation.

Another way to control trade is through import quotas, which are
numerical limitations on the quantity of products that a country can
import. For instance, during the early 1980s, the Reagan Administration
imposed a quota on the import of Japanese automobiles. In the 1970s,
many developed countries, including the United States, found themselves
with declining textile industries. Textile production does not require
highly skilled workers, so producers were able to set up lower-cost
factories in developing countries. In order to "manage" this loss of
jobs and income, the developed countries established an international
Multifiber Agreement that essentially divided the market for textile
exports between importers and the remaining domestic producers. The
agreement, which ran from 1974 to 2004, specified the exact quota of
textile imports that each developed country would accept from each
low-income country. A similar story exists for sugar imports into the
United States, which are still governed by quotas.

Nontariff barriers are all the other ways that a nation can draw up
rules, regulations, inspections, and paperwork to make it more costly or
difficult to import products. A rule requiring certain safety standards
can limit imports just as effectively as high tariffs or low import
quotas, for instance. There are also nontariff barriers in the form of
"rules-of-origin" regulations; these rules describe the "Made in Country
X" label as the one in which the last substantial change in the product
took place. A manufacturer wishing to evade import restrictions may try
to change the production process so that the last big change in the
product happens in their own country. For example, certain textiles are
made in the United States, shipped to other countries, combined with
textiles made in those other countries to make apparel---and then
re-exported back to the United States for a final assembly, to escape
paying tariffs or to obtain a "Made in the USA" label.

Despite import quotas, tariffs, and nontariff barriers, the share of
apparel sold in the United States that is imported rose from about half
in 1999 to about three-quarters today. According to the U.S. Bureau of
Labor Statistics (BLS), estimated the number of U.S. jobs in textiles
and apparel fell 44% from 2007 to 2014, and will fall by another 25% by
2024. Even more U.S. textile industry jobs would have been lost without
tariffs. However, domestic jobs that are saved by import quotas come at
a cost. Because textile and apparel protectionism adds to the costs of
imports, consumers end up paying billions of dollars more for clothing
each year.

When the United States eliminates trade barriers in one area, consumers
spend the money they save on that product elsewhere in the economy.
Thus, while eliminating trade barriers in one sector of the economy will
likely result in some job loss in that sector, consumers will spend the
resulting savings in other sectors of the economy and hence increase the
number of jobs in those other sectors. Of course, workers in some of the
poorest countries of the world who would otherwise have jobs producing
textiles, would gain considerably if the United States reduced its
barriers to trade in textiles. That said, there are good reasons to be
wary about reducing barriers to trade. The 2012 and 2013 Bangladeshi
fires in textile factories, which resulted in a horrific loss of life,
present complications that our simplified analysis in the chapter will
not capture.

Realizing the compromises between nations that come about due to trade
policy, many countries came together in 1947 to form the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). (We'll cover the GATT in more
detail later in the chapter.) This agreement has since been superseded
by the World Trade Organization (WTO), whose membership includes about
150 nations and most of the world\'s economies. It is the primary
international mechanism through which nations negotiate their trade
rules---including rules about tariffs, quotas, and nontariff barriers.
The next section examines the results of such protectionism and develops
a simple model to show the impact of trade policy.

#### Demand and Supply Analysis of Protectionism

To the non-economist, restricting imports may appear to be nothing more
than taking sales from foreign producers and giving them to domestic
producers. Other factors are at work, however, because firms do not
operate in a vacuum. Instead, firms sell their products either to
consumers or to other firms (if they are business suppliers), who are
also affected by the trade barriers. A demand and supply analysis of
protectionism shows that it is not just a matter of domestic gains and
foreign losses, but a policy that imposes substantial domestic costs as
well.

Consider two countries, Brazil and the United States, who produce sugar.
Each country has a domestic supply and demand for sugar, as @tbl-table_20_1 details and [Figure 20.2](#fig-20_2)
illustrates. In Brazil, without trade, the equilibrium price of sugar is
12 cents per pound and the equilibrium output is 30 tons. When there is
no trade in the United States, the equilibrium price of sugar is 24
cents per pound and the equilibrium quantity is 80 tons. We label these
equilibrium points as point E in each part of the figure.

![](media/20-1-protectionism-an-indirect-subsidy-from-consumers-to-producers_rId29.jpeg){width="6.5in" height="2.74in" #fig-20_2}

Figure 20.2 The Sugar Trade between Brazil and the United States Before
trade, the equilibrium price of sugar in Brazil is 12 cents a pound and
it is 24 cents per pound in the United States. When trade is allowed,
businesses will buy cheap sugar in Brazil and sell it in the United
States. This will result in higher prices in Brazil and lower prices in
the United States. Ignoring transaction costs, prices should converge to
16 cents per pound, with Brazil exporting 15 tons of sugar and the
United States importing 15 tons of sugar. If trade is only partly open
between the countries, it will lead to an outcome between the free-trade
and no-trade possibilities.

: The Sugar Trade between Brazil and the United States {#tbl-table_20_1}

If international trade between Brazil and the United States now becomes
possible, profit-seeking firms will spot an opportunity: buy sugar
cheaply in Brazil, and sell it at a higher price in the United States.
As sugar is shipped from Brazil to the United States, the quantity of
sugar produced in Brazil will be greater than Brazilian consumption
(with the extra production exported), and the amount produced in the
United States will be less than the amount of U.S. consumption (with the
extra consumption imported). Exports to the United States will reduce
the sugar supply in Brazil, raising its price. Imports into the United
States will increase the sugar supply, lowering its price. When the
sugar price is the same in both countries, there is no incentive to
trade further. As [Figure 20.2](#fig-20_2) shows, the
equilibrium with trade occurs at a price of 16 cents per pound. At that
price, the sugar farmers of Brazil supply a quantity of 40 tons, while
the consumers of Brazil buy only 25 tons.

The extra 15 tons of sugar production, shown by the horizontal gap
between the demand curve and the supply curve in Brazil, is exported to
the United States. In the United States, at a price of 16 cents, the
farmers produce a quantity of 72 tons and consumers demand a quantity of
87 tons. The excess demand of 15 tons by American consumers, shown by
the horizontal gap between demand and domestic supply at the price of 16
cents, is supplied by imported sugar. Free trade typically results in
income distribution effects, but the key is to recognize the overall
gains from trade, as [Figure 20.3](#fig-20_3) shows. Building on
the concepts that we outlined in @sec-chapter-3, 
in terms of consumer and producer surplus, [Figure
20.3](#fig-20_3) (a) shows that producers in Brazil gain by
selling more sugar at a higher price, while [Figure
20.3](#fig-20_3) (b) shows consumers in the United States
benefit from the lower price and greater availability of sugar.
Consumers in Brazil are worse off (compare their no-trade consumer
surplus with the free-trade consumer surplus) and U.S. producers of
sugar are worse off. There are gains from trade---an increase in social
surplus in each country. That is, both the United States and Brazil are
better off than they would be without trade. The following Clear It Up
feature explains how trade policy can influence low-income countries.

![](media/20-1-protectionism-an-indirect-subsidy-from-consumers-to-producers_rId36.jpeg){width="6.5in" height="3.695in" #fig-20_3}

Figure 20.3 Free Trade of Sugar Free trade results in gains from trade.
Total surplus increases in both countries, as the two blue-shaded areas
show. However, there are clear income distribution effects. Producers
gain in the exporting country, while consumers lose; and in the
importing country, consumers gain and producers lose.

#### Clear It Up {#clear-it-up .Heading3Grey}

##### Why are there low-income countries? {#why-are-there-low-income-countries .Heading4Grey}

Why are the poor countries of the world poor? There are a number of
reasons, but one of them will surprise you: the trade policies of the
high-income countries. Following is a stark review of social priorities
which the international aid organization, Oxfam International has widely
publicized.

High-income countries of the world---primarily the United States,
countries of the European Union, and Japan---subsidize their domestic
farmers collectively by about \$200 billion per year. Why does this
matter?

It matters because the support of farmers in high-income countries is
devastating to the livelihoods of farmers in low-income countries. Even
when their climate and land are well-suited to products like cotton,
rice, sugar, or milk, farmers in low-income countries find it difficult
to compete. Farm subsidies in the high-income countries cause farmers in
those countries to increase the amount they produce. This increase in
supply drives down world prices of farm products below the costs of
production. As Michael Gerson of the *Washington Post* describes it:
"\[T\]he effects in the cotton-growing regions of West Africa are
dramatic . . . keep\[ing\] millions of Africans on the edge of
malnutrition. In some of the poorest countries on Earth, cotton farmers
are some of the poorest people, earning about a dollar a day. . . . Who
benefits from the current system of subsidies? About 20,000 American
cotton producers, with an average annual income of more than \$125,000."

As if subsidies were not enough, often, the high-income countries block
agricultural exports from low-income countries. In some cases, the
situation gets even worse when the governments of high-income countries,
having bought and paid for an excess supply of farm products, give away
those products in poor countries and drive local farmers out of business
altogether.

For example, shipments of excess milk from the European Union to Jamaica
have caused great hardship for Jamaican dairy farmers. Shipments of
excess rice from the United States to Haiti drove thousands of
low-income rice farmers in Haiti out of business. The opportunity costs
of protectionism are not paid just by domestic consumers, but also by
foreign producers---and for many agricultural products, those foreign
producers are the world's poor.

Now, let's look at what happens with protectionism. U.S. sugar farmers
are likely to argue that, if only they could be protected from sugar
imported from Brazil, the United States would have higher domestic sugar
production, more jobs in the sugar industry, and American sugar farmers
would receive a higher price. If the United States government sets a
high-enough tariff on imported sugar, or sets an import quota at zero,
the result will be that the quantity of sugar traded between countries
could be reduced to zero, and the prices in each country will return to
the levels before trade was allowed.

Blocking only some trade is also possible. Suppose that the United
States passed a sugar import quota of seven tons. The United States will
import no more than seven tons of sugar, which means that Brazil can
export no more than seven tons of sugar to the United States. As a
result, the price of sugar in the United States will be 20 cents, which
is the price where the quantity demanded is seven tons greater than the
domestic quantity supplied. Conversely, if Brazil can export only seven
tons of sugar, then the price of sugar in Brazil will be 14 cents per
pound, which is the price where the domestic quantity supplied in Brazil
is seven tons greater than domestic demand.

In general, when a country sets a low or medium tariff or import quota,
the equilibrium price and quantity will be somewhere between those that
prevail with no trade and those with completely free trade. The
following Work It Out explores the impact of these trade barriers.

#### Work It Out {#work-it-out .Heading3Grey}

##### Effects of Trade Barriers {#effects-of-trade-barriers .Heading4Grey}

Let's look carefully at the effects of tariffs or quotas. If the U.S.
government imposes a tariff or quota sufficient to eliminate trade with
Brazil, two things occur: U.S. consumers pay a higher price and
therefore buy a smaller quantity of sugar. U.S. producers obtain a
higher price and they sell a larger quantity of sugar. We can measure
the effects of a tariff on producers and consumers in the United States
using two concepts that we developed in @sec-chapter-3:
consumer surplus and producer surplus.

![](media/20-1-protectionism-an-indirect-subsidy-from-consumers-to-producers_rId49.jpeg){width="3.25in" height="2.41in" #fig-20_4}

Figure 20.4 U.S. Sugar Supply and Demand When there is free trade, the
equilibrium is at point A. When there is no trade, the equilibrium is at
point E.

Step 1. Look at [Figure 20.4](#fig-20_4), which shows a
hypothetical version of the demand and supply of sugar in the United
States.

Step 2. Note that when there is free trade the sugar market is in
equilibrium at point A where Domestic Quantity Demanded (Qd) = Quantity
Supplied (Domestic Qs + Imports from Brazil) at a price of P~Trade~.

Step 3. Note, also, that imports are equal to the distance between
points C and A.

Step 4. Recall that consumer surplus is the value that consumers get
beyond what they paid for when they buy a product. Graphically, it is
the area under a demand curve but above the price. In this case, the
consumer surplus in the United States is the area of the triangle formed
by the points P~Trade~, A, and B.

Step 5. Recall, also, that producer surplus is another name for
profit---it is the income producers get above the cost of production,
which is shown by the supply curve here. In this case, the producer
surplus with trade is the area of the triangle formed by the points
P~trade~, C, and D.

Step 6. Suppose that the barriers to trade are imposed, imports are
excluded, and the price rises to P~NoTrade~. Look what happens to
producer surplus and consumer surplus. At the higher price, the domestic
quantity supplied increases from Qs to Q at point E. Because producers
are selling more quantity at a higher price, the producer surplus
increases to the area of the triangle P~NoTrade~, E, and D.

Step 7. Compare the areas of the two triangles and you will see the
increase in the producer surplus.

Step 8. Examine the consumer surplus. Consumers are now paying a higher
price to get a lower quantity (Q instead of Qd). Their consumer surplus
shrinks to the area of the triangle P~NoTrade~, E, and B.

Step 9. Determine the net effect. The producer surplus increases by the
area P~trade~, C, E, P~NoTrade~. The loss of consumer surplus, however,
is larger. It is the area P~trade~, A, E, P~NoTrade~. In other words,
consumers lose more than producers gain as a result of the trade
barriers and the United States has a lower social surplus.

#### Who Benefits and Who Pays?

Using the demand and supply model, consider the impact of protectionism
on producers and consumers in each of the two countries. For protected
producers like U.S. sugar farmers, restricting imports is clearly
positive. Without a need to face imported products, these producers are
able to sell more, at a higher price. For consumers in the country with
the protected good, in this case U.S. sugar consumers, restricting
imports is clearly negative. They end up buying a lower quantity of the
good and paying a higher price for what they do buy, compared to the
equilibrium price and quantity with trade. The following Clear It Up
feature considers why a country might outsource jobs even for a domestic
product.

#### Clear It Up {#clear-it-up-1 .Heading3Grey}

##### Why are Life Savers, an American product, not made in America? {#why-are-life-savers-an-american-product-not-made-in-america .Heading4Grey}

In 1912, Clarence Crane invented Life Savers, the hard candy with the
hole in the middle, in Cleveland, Ohio. Starting in the late 1960s and
for 35 years afterward, a plant in Holland, Michigan produced 46 billion
Life Savers a year, in 200 million rolls. However, in 2002, the Kraft
Company announced that it would close the Michigan plant and move Life
Saver production across the border to Montreal, Canada.

One reason is that Canadian workers are paid slightly less, especially
in healthcare and insurance costs that are not linked to employment
there. Another main reason is that the United States government keeps
the sugar price high for the benefit of sugar farmers, with a
combination of a government price floor program and strict quotas on
imported sugar. In recent years, the price of U.S. sugar has been about
double the price of sugar produced by the rest of the world. Life Saver
production uses over 100 tons of sugar each day, because the candies are
95% sugar.

A number of other candy companies have also reduced U.S. production and
expanded foreign production. Sugar-using industries have eliminated over
100,000 jobs over the last 20 years, more than seven times the total
employment in sugar production. While the candy industry is especially
affected by the cost of sugar, the costs are spread more broadly. U.S.
consumers pay roughly \$1 billion per year in higher food prices because
of elevated sugar costs. Meanwhile, sugar producers in low-income
countries are driven out of business. Because of the sugar subsidies to
domestic producers and the quotas on imports, they cannot sell their
output profitably, or at all, in the United States market.

The fact that protectionism pushes up prices for consumers in the
country enacting such protectionism is not always acknowledged openly,
but it is not disputed. After all, if protectionism did not benefit
domestic producers, there would not be much point in enacting such
policies in the first place. Protectionism is simply a method of
requiring consumers to subsidize producers. The subsidy is indirect,
since consumers pay for it through higher prices, rather than a direct
government subsidy paid with money collected from taxpayers. However,
protectionism works like a subsidy, nonetheless. The American satirist
Ambrose Bierce defined "tariff" this way in his 1911 book, *The Devil's
Dictionary*: "Tariff, n. A scale of taxes on imports, designed to
protect the domestic producer against the greed of his consumer."

The effect of protectionism on producers and consumers in the foreign
country is complex. When a government uses an import quota to impose
partial protectionism, Brazilian sugar producers receive a lower price
for the sugar they sell in Brazil---but a higher price for the sugar
they are allowed to export to the United States. Notice that some of the
burden of protectionism, paid by domestic consumers, ends up in the
hands of foreign producers in this case. Brazilian sugar consumers seem
to benefit from U.S. protectionism, because it reduces the price of
sugar that they pay (compared to the free-trade situation). On the other
hand, at least some of these Brazilian sugar consumers also work as
sugar farmers, so protectionism reduces their incomes and jobs.
Moreover, if trade between the countries vanishes, Brazilian consumers
would miss out on better prices for imported goods---which do not appear
in our single-market example of sugar protectionism.

The effects of protectionism on foreign countries notwithstanding,
protectionism requires domestic consumers of a product (consumers may
include either households or other firms) to pay higher prices to
benefit domestic producers of that product. In addition, when a country
enacts protectionism, it loses the economic gains it would have been
able to achieve through a combination of comparative advantage,
specialized learning, and economies of scale, concepts that we discuss
in @sec-chapter-19.


### 20.2 International Trade and Its Effects on Jobs, Wages, and Working Conditions

#### Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

-   Discuss how international trade influences the job market
-   Analyze the opportunity cost of protectionism
-   Explain how international trade impacts wages, labor standards, and
    working conditions

In theory at least, imports might injure workers in several different
ways: fewer jobs, lower wages, or poor working conditions. Let's
consider these in turn.

#### Fewer Jobs?

In the early 1990s, the United States was negotiating the North American
Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)[1](#fs-idm352845312) with Mexico, an
agreement that reduced tariffs, import quotas, and nontariff barriers to
trade between the United States, Mexico, and Canada. H. Ross Perot, a
1992 candidate for U.S. president, claimed, in prominent campaign
arguments, that if the United States expanded trade with Mexico, there
would be a "giant sucking sound" as U.S. employers relocated to Mexico
to take advantage of lower wages. After all, average wages in Mexico
were, at that time, about one-eighth of those in the United States.
NAFTA passed Congress, President Bill Clinton signed it into law, and it
took effect in 1995. For the next six years, the United States economy
had some of the most rapid job growth and low unemployment in its
history. Those who feared that open trade with Mexico would lead to a
dramatic decrease in jobs were proven wrong.

1

As of July 1, 2020, NAFTA was officially replaced with the United
States-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) free trade agreement. It is broadly similar
to the original NAFTA.

This result was no surprise to economists. After all, the trend toward
globalization has been going on for decades, not just since NAFTA. If
trade reduced the number of available jobs, then the United States
should have been seeing a steady loss of jobs for decades. While the
United States economy does experience rises and falls in unemployment
rates, the number of jobs is not falling over extended periods of time.
The number of U.S. jobs rose from 71 million in 1970 to 150 million in
2021.

Protectionism certainly saves jobs in the specific industry being
protected but, for two reasons, it costs jobs in other unprotected
industries. First, if consumers are paying higher prices to the
protected industry, they inevitably have less money to spend on goods
from other industries, and so jobs are lost in those other industries.
Second, if a firm sells the protected product to other firms, so that
other firms must now pay a higher price for a key input, then those
firms will lose sales to foreign producers who do not need to pay the
higher price. Lost sales translate into lost jobs. The hidden
opportunity cost of using protectionism to save jobs in one industry is
jobs sacrificed in other industries. This is why the United States
International Trade Commission, in its study of barriers to trade,
predicts that reducing trade barriers would not lead to an overall loss
of jobs. Protectionism reshuffles jobs from industries without import
protections to industries that are protected from imports, but it does
not create more jobs.

Moreover, the costs of saving jobs through protectionism can be very
high. A number of different studies have attempted to estimate the cost
to consumers in higher prices per job saved through protectionism.
@tbl-table_20_2 shows a sample of results, compiled by
economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. Saving a job through
protectionism typically costs much more than the actual worker's salary.
For example, a study published in 2002 compiled evidence that using
protectionism to save an average job in the textile and apparel industry
would cost \$199,000 per job saved. In other words, those workers could
have been paid \$100,000 per year to be unemployed and the cost would
only be half of what it is to keep them working in the textile and
apparel industry. This result is not unique to textiles and apparel.

: Cost to U.S. Consumers of Saving a Job through Protectionism
(Source: Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas) {#tbl-table_20_2}

Why does it cost so much to save jobs through protectionism? The basic
reason is that not all of the extra money that consumers pay because of
tariffs or quotas goes to save jobs. For example, if the government
imposes tariffs on steel imports so that steel buyers pay a higher
price, U.S. steel companies earn greater profits, buy more equipment,
pay bigger bonuses to managers, give pay raises to existing
employees---and also avoid firing some additional workers. Only part of
the higher price of protected steel goes toward saving jobs. Also, when
an industry is protected, the economy as a whole loses the benefits of
playing to its comparative advantage---in other words, producing what it
is best at. Therefore, part of the higher price that consumers pay for
protected goods is lost economic efficiency, which we can measure as
another deadweight loss, like what we discussed in @sec-chapter-4.

There's a bumper sticker that speaks to the threat some U.S. workers
feel from imported products: "Buy American---Save U.S. Jobs." If an
economist were driving the car, the sticker might declare: "Block
Imports---Save Jobs for Some Americans, Lose Jobs for Other Americans,
and Also Pay High Prices."

#### Trade and Wages

Even if trade does not reduce the number of jobs, it could affect wages.
Here, it is important to separate issues about the average level of
wages from issues about whether the wages of certain workers may be
helped or hurt by trade.

Because trade raises the amount that an economy can produce by letting
firms and workers play to their comparative advantage, trade will also
cause the average level of wages in an economy to rise. Workers who can
produce more will be more desirable to employers, which will shift the
demand for their labor out to the right, and increase wages in the labor
market. By contrast, barriers to trade will reduce the average level of
wages in an economy.

However, even if trade increases the overall wage level, it will still
benefit some workers and hurt others. Workers in industries that are
confronted by competition from imported products may find that demand
for their labor decreases and shifts back to the left, so that their
wages decline with a rise in international trade. Conversely, workers in
industries that benefit from selling in global markets may find that
demand for their labor shifts out to the right, so that trade raises
their wages.

article on the issues surrounding fair trade coffee.

One concern is that while globalization may be benefiting high-skilled,
high-wage workers in the United States, it may also impose costs on
low-skilled, low-wage workers. After all, high-skilled U.S. workers
presumably benefit from increased sales of sophisticated products like
computers, machinery, and pharmaceuticals in which the United States has
a comparative advantage. Meanwhile, low-skilled U.S. workers must now
compete against extremely low-wage workers worldwide for making simpler
products like toys and clothing. As a result, the wages of low-skilled
U.S. workers are likely to fall. There are, however, a number of reasons
to believe that while globalization has helped some U.S. industries and
hurt others, it has not focused its negative impact on the wages of
low-skilled Americans. First, about half of U.S. trade is intra-industry
trade. That means the U.S. trades similar goods with other high-wage
economies like Canada, Japan, Germany, and the United Kingdom. For
instance, in 2014 the U.S. exported over 2 million cars, from all the
major automakers, and also imported several million cars from other
countries.

Most U.S. workers in these industries have above-average skills and
wages---and many of them do quite well in the world of globalization.
Some evidence suggested that intra-industry trade between similar
countries had a small impact on domestic workers but later evidence
indicates that it all depends on how flexible the labor market is. In
other words, the key is how flexible workers are in finding jobs in
different industries. The effect of trade on low-wage workers depends
considerably on the structure of labor markets and indirect effects felt
in other parts of the economy. For example, in the United States and the
United Kingdom, because labor market frictions are low, the impact of
trade on low income workers is small.

Second, many low-skilled U.S. workers hold service jobs that imports
from low-wage countries cannot replace. For example, we cannot import
lawn care services or moving and hauling services or hotel maids from
countries long distances away like China or Bangladesh. Competition from
imported products is not the primary determinant of their wages.

Finally, while the focus of the discussion here is on wages, it is worth
pointing out that low-wage U.S. workers suffer due to protectionism in
all the industries---even those in which they do not work. For example,
food and clothing are protected industries. These low-wage workers
therefore pay higher prices for these basic necessities and as such
their dollar stretches over fewer goods.

The benefits and costs of increased trade in terms of its effect on
wages are not distributed evenly across the economy. However, the growth
of international trade has helped to raise the productivity of U.S.
workers as a whole---and thus helped to raise the average level of
wages.

#### Labor Standards and Working Conditions

Workers in many low-income countries around the world labor under
conditions that would be illegal for a worker in the United States.
Workers in countries like China, Thailand, Brazil, South Africa, and
Poland are often paid less than the United States minimum wage. For
example, in the United States, the national minimum wage is \$7.25 per
hour. A typical wage in many low-income countries might be more like
\$7.25 per day, or often much less. Moreover, working conditions in
low-income countries may be extremely unpleasant, or even unsafe. In the
worst cases, production may involve the child labor or even workers who
are mistreated, abused, or entrapped in their jobs. These concerns over
foreign labor standards do not affect most of U.S. trade, which is
intra-industry and carried out with other high-income countries that
have labor standards similar to the United States, but it is,
nonetheless, morally and economically important.

In thinking about labor standards in other countries, it is important to
draw some distinctions between what is truly unacceptable and what is
painful to think about. Most people, economists included, have little
difficulty with the idea that production by six-year-olds confined in
factories, by people who are abused or mistreated, or by slave labor is
morally unacceptable. They would support aggressive efforts to eliminate
such practices---including shutting out imported products made with such
labor. Many cases, however, are less clear-cut. An opinion article in
the *New York Times* several years ago described the case of Ahmed Zia,
a 14-year-old boy from Pakistan. He earned \$2 per day working in a
carpet factory. He dropped out of school in second grade. Should the
United States and other countries refuse to purchase rugs made by Ahmed
and his co-workers? If the carpet factories were to close, the likely
alternative job for Ahmed is farm work, and as Ahmed says of his
carpet-weaving job: "This makes much more money and is more
comfortable."

Other workers may have even less attractive alternative jobs, perhaps
scavenging garbage or prostitution. The real problem for Ahmed and many
others in low-income countries is not that globalization has made their
lives worse, but rather that they have so few good life alternatives.
The United States went through similar situations during the nineteenth
and early twentieth centuries.

In closing, there is some irony when the United States government or
U.S. citizens take issue with labor standards in low-income countries,
because the United States is not a world leader in government laws to
protect employees. According to a recent study by the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the U.S. is the only one of
41 countries that does not provide mandated paid leave for new parents,
and among the 40 countries that do mandate paid leave, the minimum
duration is about two months. Many European workers receive six weeks or
more of paid vacation per year. In the United States, vacations are
often one to three weeks per year. If European countries accused the
United States of using unfair labor standards to make U.S. products
cheaply, and announced that they would shut out all U.S. imports until
the United States adopted paid parental leave, added more national
holidays, and doubled vacation time, Americans would be outraged. Yet
when U.S. protectionists start talking about restricting imports from
poor countries because of low wage levels and poor working conditions,
they are making a very similar argument. This is not to say that labor
conditions in low-income countries are not an important issue. They are.
However, linking labor conditions in low-income countries to trade
deflects the emphasis from the real question to ask: "What are
acceptable and enforceable minimum labor standards and protections to
have the world over?"


### 20.3 Arguments in Support of Restricting Imports

#### Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

-   Explain and analyze various arguments that are in support of
    restricting imports, including the infant industry argument, the
    anti-dumping argument, the environmental protection argument, the
    unsafe consumer products argument, and the national interest
    argument
-   Explain dumping and race to the bottom
-   Evaluate the significance of countries' perceptions on the benefits
    of growing trade

As we previously noted, protectionism requires domestic consumers of a
product to pay higher prices to benefit domestic producers of that
product. Countries that institute protectionist policies lose the
economic gains achieved through a combination of comparative advantage,
specialized learning, and economies of scale. With these overall costs
in mind, let us now consider, one by one, a number of arguments that
support restricting imports.

#### The Infant Industry Argument

Imagine Bhutan wants to start its own computer industry, but it has no
computer firms that can produce at a low enough price and high enough
quality to compete in world markets. However, Bhutanese politicians,
business leaders, and workers hope that if the local industry had a
chance to get established, before it needed to face international
competition, then a domestic company or group of companies could develop
the skills, management, technology, and economies of scale that it needs
to become a successful profit-earning domestic industry. Thus, the
infant industry argument for protectionism is to block imports for a
limited time, to give the infant industry time to mature, before it
starts competing on equal terms in the global economy.

The infant industry argument is theoretically possible, even sensible:
give an industry a short-term indirect subsidy through protection, and
then reap the long-term economic benefits of having a vibrant, healthy
industry. Implementation, however, is tricky. In many countries, infant
industries have gone from babyhood to senility and obsolescence without
ever having reached the profitable maturity stage. Meanwhile, the
protectionism that was supposed to be short-term often took a very long
time to be repealed.

As one example, Brazil treated its computer industry as an infant
industry from the late 1970s until about 1990. In an attempt to
establish its computer industry in the global economy, Brazil largely
barred imports of computer products for several decades. This policy
guaranteed increased sales for Brazilian computers. However, by the
mid-1980s, due to lack of international competition, Brazil had a
backward and out-of-date industry, typically lagging behind world
standards for price and performance by three to five years---a long time
in this fast-moving industry. After more than a decade, during which
Brazilian consumers and industries that would have benefited from
up-to-date computers paid the costs and Brazil's computer industry never
competed effectively on world markets, Brazil phased out its infant
industry policy for the computer industry.

Protectionism for infant industries always imposes costs on domestic
users of the product, and typically has provided little benefit in the
form of stronger, competitive industries. However, several countries in
East Asia offer an exception. Japan, Korea, Thailand, and other
countries in this region have sometimes provided a package of indirect
and direct subsidies targeted at certain industries, including
protection from foreign competition and government loans at interest
rates below the market equilibrium. In Japan and Korea, for example,
subsidies helped get their domestic steel and auto industries up and
running.

Why did the infant industry policy of protectionism and other subsidies
work fairly well in East Asia? An early 1990 World Bank study offered
three guidelines to countries thinking about infant industry protection:

1.  Do not hand out protectionism and other subsidies to all industries,
    but focus on a few industries where your country has a realistic
    chance to be a world-class producer.
2.  Be very hesitant about using protectionism in areas like computers,
    where many other industries rely on having the best products
    available, because it is not useful to help one industry by imposing
    high costs on many other industries.
3.  Have clear guidelines for when the infant industry policy will end.

In Korea in the 1970s and 1980s, a common practice was to link
protectionism and subsidies to export sales in global markets. If export
sales rose, then the infant industry had succeeded and the government
could phase out protectionism. If export sales did not rise, then the
infant industry policy had failed and the government could phase out
protectionism. Either way, the protectionism would be temporary.

Following these rules is easier said than done. Politics often intrudes,
both in choosing which industries will receive the benefits of treatment
as "infants" and when to phase out import restrictions and other
subsidies. Also, if the country\'s government wishes to impose costs on
its citizens so that it can provide subsidies to a few key industries,
it has many tools for doing such as direct government payments, loans,
targeted tax reductions, and government support of research and
development of new technologies. In other words, protectionism is not
the only or even the best way to support key industries.

#### The Anti-Dumping Argument

Dumping refers to selling goods below their cost of production.
Anti-dumping laws block imports that are sold below the cost of
production by imposing tariffs that increase the price of these imports
to reflect their cost of production. Since dumping is not allowed under
World Trade Organization (WTO) rules, nations that believe they are on
the receiving end of dumped goods can file a complaint with the WTO.
According to the WTO, between 1995 and 2020, it oversaw 137 anti-dumping
disputes. Note that dumping cases are countercyclical. During
recessions, case filings increase. During economic booms, case filings
go down. Individual countries have also frequently started their own
anti-dumping investigations. The U.S. government has dozens of
anti-dumping orders in place from past investigations. In 2022, for
example, some U.S. imports that were under anti-dumping orders included
olives from Spain, steel from South Korea, coated paper from Indonesia,
light commercial vehicles from Germany and Italy, fish fillets from
Vietnam, and cellulose pulp from Canada.

**Why Might Dumping Occur?**

Why would foreign firms export a product at less than its cost of
production---which presumably means taking a loss? This question has two
possible answers, one innocent and one more sinister.

The innocent explanation is that demand and supply set market prices,
not the cost of production. Perhaps demand for a product shifts back to
the left or supply shifts out to the right, which drives the market
price to low levels---even below the cost of production. When a local
store has a going-out-of-business sale, for example, it may sell goods
at below the cost of production. If international companies find that
there is excess supply of steel or computer chips or machine tools that
is driving the market price down below their cost of production---this
may be the market in action.

The sinister explanation is that dumping is part of a long-term
strategy. Foreign firms sell goods at prices below the cost of
production for a short period of time, and when they have driven out the
domestic U.S. competition, they then raise prices. Economists sometimes
call this scenario predatory pricing, which we discuss in @sec-chapter-9.

**Should Anti-Dumping Cases Be Limited?**

Anti-dumping cases pose two questions. How much sense do they make in
economic theory? How much sense do they make as practical policy?

In terms of economic theory, the case for anti-dumping laws is weak. In
a market governed by demand and supply, the government does not
guarantee that firms will be able to make a profit. After all, low
prices are difficult for producers, but benefit consumers. Moreover,
although there are plenty of cases in which foreign producers have
driven out domestic firms, there are zero documented cases in which the
foreign producers then jacked up prices. Instead, foreign producers
typically continue competing hard against each other and providing low
prices to consumers. In short, it is difficult to find evidence of
predatory pricing by foreign firms exporting to the United States.

Even if one could make a case that the government should sometimes enact
anti-dumping rules in the short term, and then allow free trade to
resume shortly thereafter, there is a growing concern that anti-dumping
investigations often involve more politics than careful analysis. The
U.S. Commerce Department is charged with calculating the appropriate
"cost of production," which can be as much an art as a science.

For example, if a company built a new factory two years ago, should it
count part of the factory's cost in this year's cost of production? When
a company is in a country where the government controls prices, like
China for example, how can one measure the true cost of production? When
a domestic industry complains loudly enough, government regulators seem
very likely to find that unfair dumping has occurred. A common pattern
has arisen where a domestic industry files an anti-dumping complaint,
the governments meet and negotiate a reduction in imports, and then the
domestic producers drop the anti-dumping suit. In such cases,
anti-dumping cases often appear to be little more than a cover story for
imposing tariffs or import quotas.

In the 1980s, the United States, Canada, the European Union, Australia,
and New Zealand implemented almost all the anti-dumping cases. By the
2000s, countries like Argentina, Brazil, South Korea, South Africa,
Mexico, and India were filing the majority of the anti-dumping cases
before the WTO. As the number of anti-dumping cases has increased, and
as countries such as the United States and the European Union feel
targeted by the anti-dumping actions of others, the WTO may well propose
some additional guidelines to limit the reach of anti-dumping laws.

#### The Environmental Protection Argument

The potential for global trade to affect the environment has become
controversial. A president of the Sierra Club, an environmental lobbying
organization, once wrote: "The consequences of globalization for the
environment are not good. ... Globalization, if we are lucky, will raise
average incomes enough to pay for cleaning up some of the mess that we
have made. But before we get there, globalization could also destroy
enough of the planet's basic biological and physical systems that
prospects for life itself will be radically compromised."

If free trade meant the destruction of life itself, then even economists
would convert to protectionism! While globalization---and economic
activity of all kinds---can pose environmental dangers, it seems quite
possible that, with the appropriate safeguards in place, we can minimize
the environmental impacts of trade. In some cases, trade may even bring
environmental benefits.

In general, high-income countries such as the United States, Canada,
Japan, the United Kingdom, and the nations of the European Union have
relatively strict environmental standards. In contrast, middle- and
low-income countries like Brazil, Nigeria, India, and China have lower
environmental standards. The general view of the governments of such
countries is that environmental protection is a luxury: as soon as their
people have enough to eat, decent healthcare, and longer life
expectancies, then they will spend more money on items such as sewage
treatment plants, scrubbers to reduce air pollution from factory
smokestacks, and national parks to protect wildlife.

This gap in environmental standards between high-income and low-income
countries raises two worrisome possibilities in a world of increasing
global trade: the "race to the bottom" scenario and the question of how
quickly environmental standards will improve in low-income countries.

**The Race to the Bottom Scenario**

The race to the bottom scenario of global environmental degradation runs
like this. Profit-seeking multinational companies shift their production
from countries with strong environmental standards to countries with
weak standards, thus reducing their costs and increasing their profits.
Faced with such behavior, countries reduce their environmental standards
to attract multinational firms, which, after all, provide jobs and
economic clout. As a result, global production becomes concentrated in
countries where firms can pollute the most and environmental laws
everywhere "race to the bottom."

Although the race-to-the-bottom scenario sounds plausible, it does not
appear to describe reality. In fact, the financial incentive for firms
to shift production to poor countries to take advantage of their weaker
environmental rules does not seem especially powerful. When firms decide
where to locate a new factory, they look at many different factors: the
costs of labor and financial capital; whether the location is close to a
reliable suppliers of the inputs that they need; whether the location is
close to customers; the quality of transportation, communications, and
electrical power networks; the level of taxes; and the competence and
honesty of the local government. The cost of environmental regulations
is a factor, too, but typically environmental costs are no more than 1
to 2% of the costs that a large industrial plant faces. The other
factors that determine location are much more important to these
companies than trying to skimp on environmental protection costs.

When an international company does choose to build a plant in a
low-income country with lax environmental laws, it typically builds a
plant similar to those that it operates in high-income countries with
stricter environmental standards. Part of the reason for this decision
is that designing an industrial plant is a complex and costly task, and
so if a plant works well in a high-income country, companies prefer to
use the same design everywhere. Also, companies realize that if they
create an environmental disaster in a low-income country, it is likely
to cost them a substantial amount of money in paying for damages, lost
trust, and reduced sales---by building up-to-date plants everywhere they
minimize such risks. As a result of these factors, foreign-owned plants
in low-income countries often have a better record of compliance with
environmental laws than do locally-owned plants.

**Pressuring Low-Income Countries for Higher Environmental Standards**

In some cases, the issue is not so much whether globalization will
pressure low-income countries to reduce their environmental standards,
but instead whether the threat of blocking international trade can
pressure these countries into adopting stronger standards. For example,
restrictions on ivory imports in high-income countries, along with
stronger government efforts to catch elephant poachers, have been
credited with helping to reduce the illegal poaching of elephants in
certain African countries.

However, it would be highly undemocratic for the well-fed citizens of
high-income countries to attempt to dictate to the ill-fed citizens of
low-income countries what domestic policies and priorities they must
adopt, or how they should balance environmental goals against other
priorities for their citizens. Furthermore, if high-income countries
want stronger environmental standards in low-income countries, they have
many options other than the threat of protectionism. For example,
high-income countries could pay for anti-pollution equipment in
low-income countries, or could help to pay for national parks.
High-income countries could help pay for and carry out the scientific
and economic studies that would help environmentalists in low-income
countries to make a more persuasive case for the economic benefits of
protecting the environment.

After all, environmental protection is vital to two industries of key
importance in many low-income countries---agriculture and tourism.
Environmental advocates can set up standards for labeling products, like
"this tuna caught in a net that kept dolphins safe" or "this product
made only with wood not taken from rainforests," so that consumer
pressure can reinforce environmentalist values. The United Nations also
reinforces these values, by sponsoring treaties to address issues such
as climate change and global warming, the preservation of biodiversity,
the spread of deserts, and the environmental health of the seabed.
Countries that share a national border or are within a region often sign
environmental agreements about air and water rights, too. The WTO is
also becoming more aware of environmental issues and more careful about
ensuring that increases in trade do not inflict environmental damage.

Finally, note that these concerns about the race to the bottom or
pressuring low-income countries for more strict environmental standards
do not apply very well to the roughly half of all U.S. trade that occurs
with other high-income countries. Many European countries have stricter
environmental standards in certain industries than the United States.

#### The Unsafe Consumer Products Argument

One argument for shutting out certain imported products is that they are
unsafe for consumers. Consumer rights groups have sometimes warned that
the World Trade Organization would require nations to reduce their
health and safety standards for imported products. However, the WTO
explains its current agreement on the subject in this way: "It allows
countries to set their own standards." It also says "regulations must be
based on science. . . . And they should not arbitrarily or unjustifiably
discriminate between countries where identical or similar conditions
prevail." Thus, for example, under WTO rules it is perfectly legitimate
for the United States to pass laws requiring that *all* food products or
cars sold in the United States meet certain safety standards approved by
the United States government, whether or not other countries choose to
pass similar standards. However, such standards must have some
scientific basis. It is improper to impose one set of health and safety
standards for domestically produced goods but a different set of
standards for imports, or one set of standards for imports from Europe
and a different set of standards for imports from Latin America.

In 2007, Mattel recalled nearly two million toys imported from China due
to concerns about high levels of lead in the paint, as well as some
loose parts. It is unclear if other toys were subject to similar
standards. In 2013, Japan blocked imports of U.S. wheat because of
concerns that genetically modified (GMO) wheat might be included in the
shipments. The science on the impact of GMOs on health is still
developing.

#### The National Interest Argument

Some argue that a nation should not depend too heavily on other
countries for supplies of certain key products, such as oil, or for
special materials or technologies that might have national security
applications. On closer consideration, this argument for protectionism
proves rather weak.

As an example, in the United States, oil provides about 36% of all the
energy and 21% of the oil used in the United States economy is imported.
Several times in the last few decades, when disruptions in the Middle
East have shifted the supply curve of oil back to the left and sharply
raised the price, the effects have been felt across the United States
economy. This is not, however, a very convincing argument for
restricting oil imports. If the United States needs to be protected from
a possible cutoff of foreign oil, then a more reasonable strategy would
be to import 100% of the petroleum supply now, and save U.S. domestic
oil resources for when or if the foreign supply is cut off. It might
also be useful to import extra oil and put it into a stockpile for use
in an emergency, as the United States government did by starting a
Strategic Petroleum Reserve in 1977. Moreover, it may be necessary to
discourage people from using oil, and to start a high-powered program to
seek out alternatives to oil. A straightforward way to do this would be
to raise taxes on oil. Additionally, it makes no sense to argue that
because oil is highly important to the United States economy, then the
United States should shut out oil imports and use up its domestic
supplies more quickly. U.S. domestic oil production is increasing. Shale
oil is adding to domestic supply using fracking extraction techniques.

Whether or not to limit certain kinds of imports of key technologies or
materials that might be important to national security and weapons
systems is a slightly different issue. If weapons' builders are not
confident that they can continue to obtain a key product in wartime,
they might decide to avoid designing weapons that use this key product,
or they can go ahead and design the weapons and stockpile enough of the
key high-tech components or materials to last through an armed conflict.
There is a U.S. Defense National Stockpile Center that has built up
reserves of many materials, from aluminum oxides, antimony, and bauxite
to tungsten, vegetable tannin extracts, and zinc (although many of these
stockpiles have been reduced and sold in recent years). Think every
country is pro-trade? How about the U.S.? The following Clear It Up
might surprise you.

#### Clear It Up {#clear-it-up .Heading3Grey}

##### How does the United States really feel about expanding trade? {#how-does-the-united-states-really-feel-about-expanding-trade .Heading4Grey}

How do people around the world feel about expanding trade between
nations? In summer 2007, the Pew Foundation surveyed 45,000 people in 47
countries. One of the questions asked about opinions on growing trade
ties between countries. @tbl-table_20_3 shows the percentages
who answered either "very good" or "somewhat good" for some of countries
surveyed.

For those who think of the United States as the world's leading
supporter of expanding trade, the survey results may be perplexing. When
adding up the shares of those who say that growing trade ties between
countries is "very good" or "somewhat good," Americans had the least
favorable attitude toward increasing globalization, while the Chinese
and South Africans ranked highest. In fact, among the 47 countries
surveyed, the United States ranked by far the lowest on this measure,
followed by Egypt, Italy, and Argentina.

| Country        | Very Good | Somewhat Good | Total |
|----------------|-----------|---------------|-------|
| China          | 38%       | 53%           | 91%   |
| South Africa   | 42%       | 43%           | 87%   |
| South Korea    | 24%       | 62%           | 86%   |
| Germany        | 30%       | 55%           | 85%   |
| Canada         | 29%       | 53%           | 82%   |
| United Kingdom | 28%       | 50%           | 78%   |
| Mexico         | 22%       | 55%           | 77%   |
| Brazil         | 13%       | 59%           | 72%   |
| Japan          | 17%       | 55%           | 72%   |
| United States  | 14%       | 45%           | 59%   |

One final reason why economists often treat the national interest
argument skeptically is that lobbyists and politicians can tout almost
any product as vital to national security. In 1954, the United States
became worried that it was importing half of the wool required for
military uniforms, so it declared wool and mohair to be "strategic
materials" and began to give subsidies to wool and mohair farmers.
Although the government removed wool from the official list of
"strategic" materials in 1960, the subsidies for mohair continued for
almost 40 years until the government repealed them in 1993, and then
reinstated them in 2002. All too often, the national interest argument
has become an excuse for handing out the indirect subsidy of
protectionism to certain industries or companies. After all,
politicians, not nonpartisan analysts make decisions about what
constitutes a key strategic material.


### 20.4 How Governments Enact Trade Policy: Globally, Regionally, and Nationally

#### Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

-   Explain the origin and role of the World Trade Organization (WTO)
    and General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)
-   Discuss the significance and provide examples of regional trading
    agreements
-   Analyze trade policy at the national level
-   Evaluate long-term trends in barriers to trade

These public policy arguments about how nations should react to
globalization and trade are fought out at several levels: at the global
level through the World Trade Organization and through regional trade
agreements between pairs or groups of countries.

#### The World Trade Organization

The World Trade Organization (WTO) was officially born in 1995, but its
history is much longer. In the years after the Great Depression and
World War II, there was a worldwide push to build institutions that
would tie the nations of the world together. The United Nations
officially came into existence in 1945. The World Bank, which assists
the poorest people in the world, and the International Monetary Fund,
which addresses issues raised by international financial transactions,
were both created in 1946. The third planned organization was to be an
International Trade Organization, which would manage international
trade. The United Nations was unable to agree to this. Instead, 27
nations signed the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in
Geneva, Switzerland on October 30, 1947 to provide a forum in which
nations could come together to negotiate reductions in tariffs and other
barriers to trade. In 1995, the GATT transformed into the WTO.

The GATT process was to negotiate an agreement to reduce barriers to
trade, sign that agreement, pause for a while, and then start
negotiating the next agreement. @tbl-table_20_4 shows rounds
of talks in the GATT, and now the WTO. Notice that the early rounds of
GATT talks took a relatively short time, included a small number of
countries, and focused almost entirely on reducing tariffs. Since the
mid-1960s, however, rounds of trade talks have taken years, included a
large number of countries, and have included an ever-broadening range of
issues.

| Year | Place or Name of Round | Main Subjects                                            | Number of Countries Involved |

: The Negotiating Rounds of GATT and the World Trade Organization {#tbl-table_20_4}

The sluggish pace of GATT negotiations led to an old joke that GATT
really stood for Gentleman's Agreement to Talk and Talk. The slow pace
of international trade talks, however, is understandable, even sensible.
Having dozens of nations agree to any treaty is a lengthy process. GATT
often set up separate trading rules for certain industries, like
agriculture, and separate trading rules for certain countries, like the
low-income countries. There were rules, exceptions to rules,
opportunities to opt out of rules, and precise wording to be fought over
in every case. Like the GATT before it, the WTO is not a world
government, with power to impose its decisions on others. The total
staff of the WTO Secretariat in 2021 is 625 people and its annual budget
(as of 2020) is \$197 million, which makes it smaller in size than many
large universities.

#### Regional Trading Agreements

There are different types of economic integration across the globe,
ranging from free trade agreements, in which participants allow each
other's imports without tariffs or quotas, to common markets, in which
participants have a common external trade policy as well as free trade
within the group, to full economic unions, in which, in addition to a
common market, monetary and fiscal policies are coordinated. Many
nations belong both to the World Trade Organization and to regional
trading agreements.

The best known of these regional trading agreements is the European
Union. In the years after World War II, leaders of several European
nations reasoned that if they could tie their economies together more
closely, they might be more likely to avoid another devastating war.
Their efforts began with a free trade association, evolved into a common
market, and then transformed into what is now a full economic union,
known as the European Union. The EU, as it is often called, has a number
of goals. For example, in the early 2000s it introduced a common
currency for Europe, the euro, and phased out most of the former
national forms of money like the German mark and the French franc,
though a few have retained their own currency. Another key element of
the union is to eliminate barriers to the mobility of goods, labor, and
capital across Europe. In 2016, Britain voted to leave the European
Union---a move that was completed in January 2020.

For the United States, perhaps the best-known regional trading agreement
is the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
[2](#fs-idm352745318) The United States also participates in some
less-prominent regional trading agreements, like the Caribbean Basin
Initiative, which offers reduced tariffs for imports from these
countries, and a free trade agreement with Israel.

2

As of July 1, 2020, NAFTA was officially replaced with the United
States-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) free trade agreement. It is broadly similar
to the original NAFTA.

The world has seen a flood of regional trading agreements in recent
years. About 100 such agreements are now in place. @tbl-table_20_5 lists a few of the more prominent ones. Some are
just agreements to continue talking. Others set specific goals for
reducing tariffs, import quotas, and nontariff barriers. One economist
described the current trade treaties as a "spaghetti bowl," which is
what a map with lines connecting all the countries with trade treaties
looks like.

There is concern among economists who favor free trade that some of
these regional agreements may promise free trade, but actually act as a
way for the countries within the regional agreement to try to limit
trade from anywhere else. In some cases, the regional trade agreements
may even conflict with the broader agreements of the World Trade
Organization.

: Some Regional Trade Agreements \* Following the 2016
referendum vote to leave the European Union, the UK government triggered
the withdrawal process on March 29, 2017, setting the date for the UK to
leave by April 2019. In January 2020, the withdrawal was complete and
the United Kingdom is now no longer part of the EU trading bloc. Also,
as of 2020, NAFTA has been replaced by the United States-Mexico-Canada
(USMCA) free trade agreement. {#tbl-table_20_5}

#### Trade Policy at the National Level

Yet another dimension of trade policy, along with international and
regional trade agreements, happens at the national level. The United
States, for example, imposes import quotas on sugar, because of a fear
that such imports would drive down the price of sugar and thus injure
domestic sugar producers. One of the jobs of the United States
Department of Commerce is to determine if there is import dumping from
other countries. The United States International Trade Commission---a
government agency---determines whether the dumping has substantially
injured domestic industries, and if so, the president can impose tariffs
that are intended to offset the unfairly low price.

In the arena of trade policy, the battle often seems to be between
national laws that increase protectionism and international agreements
that try to reduce protectionism, like the WTO. Why would a country pass
laws or negotiate agreements to shut out certain foreign products, like
sugar or textiles, while simultaneously negotiating to reduce trade
barriers in general? One plausible answer is that international trade
agreements offer a method for countries to restrain their own special
interests. A member of Congress can say to an industry lobbying for
tariffs or quotas on imports: "Sure would like to help you, but that
pesky WTO agreement just won't let me."

#### Link It Up {#link-it-up .Heading3Grey}

If consumers are the biggest losers from trade, why do they not fight
back? The quick answer is because it is easier to organize a small group
of people around a narrow interest (producers) versus a large group that
has diffuse interests (consumers). This is a question about trade policy
theory. Visit this [website](https://www.britannica.com/topic/collective-action-problem-1917157) and read
the article by Jonathan Rauch.

#### Long-Term Trends in Barriers to Trade

In newspaper headlines, trade policy appears mostly as disputes and
acrimony. Countries are almost constantly threatening to challenge other
nations\' "unfair" trading practices. Cases are brought to the dispute
settlement procedures of the WTO, the European Union, NAFTA, and other
regional trading agreements. Politicians in national legislatures,
goaded on by lobbyists, often threaten to pass bills that will
"establish a fair playing field" or "prevent unfair trade"---although
most such bills seek to accomplish these high-sounding goals by placing
more restrictions on trade. Protesters in the streets may object to
specific trade rules or to the entire practice of international trade.

Through all the controversy, the general trend in the last 60 years is
clearly toward lower barriers to trade. The average level of tariffs on
imported products charged by industrialized countries was 40% in 1946.
By 1990, after decades of GATT negotiations, it was down to less than
5%. One of the reasons that GATT negotiations shifted from focusing on
tariff reduction in the early rounds to a broader agenda was that
tariffs had been reduced so dramatically there was not much more to do
in that area. U.S. tariffs have followed this general pattern: After
rising sharply during the Great Depression, tariffs dropped off to less
than 2% by the end of the century. Although measures of import quotas
and nontariff barriers are less exact than those for tariffs, they
generally appear to be at lower levels than they had been previously,
too.

Thus, the last half-century has seen both a dramatic reduction in
government-created barriers to trade, such as tariffs, import quotas,
and nontariff barriers, and also a number of technological developments
that have made international trade easier, like advances in
transportation, communication, and information management. The result
has been the powerful surge of international trade.

These trends were altered by two important events in 2016: the UK vote
to leave the EU and the election of President Trump in the United
States, whose administration pursued a policy of raising trade barriers.
In 2018, tariffs on a broad range of imports from China were raised by
around 25%. As of 2022, the UK has been out of the EU for two years, and
it remains unclear if President Biden's administration will adjust or
remove President Trump's trade barriers.


### 20.5 The Tradeoffs of Trade Policy

#### Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

-   Asses the complexity of international trade
-   Discuss why a market-oriented economy is so affected by
    international trade
-   Explain disruptive market change

Economists readily acknowledge that international trade is not all
sunshine, roses, and happy endings. Over time, the average person gains
from international trade, both as a worker who has greater productivity
and higher wages because of the benefits of specialization and
comparative advantage, and as a consumer who can benefit from shopping
all over the world for a greater variety of quality products at
attractive prices. The "average person," however, is hypothetical, not
real---representing a mix of those who have done very well, those who
have done all right, and those who have done poorly. It is a legitimate
concern of public policy to focus not just on the average or on the
success stories, but also on those who have not been so fortunate.
Workers in other countries, the environment, and prospects for new
industries and materials that might be of key importance to the national
economy are also all legitimate issues.

The common belief among economists is that it is better to embrace the
gains from trade, and then deal with the costs and tradeoffs with other
policy tools, than it is to cut off trade to avoid the costs and
tradeoffs.

To gain a better intuitive understanding for this argument, consider a
hypothetical American company called Technotron. Technotron invents a
new scientific technology that allows the firm to increase the output
and quality of its goods with a smaller number of workers at a lower
cost. As a result of this technology, other U.S. firms in this industry
will lose money and will also have to lay off workers---and some of the
competing firms will even go bankrupt. Should the United States
government protect the existing firms and their employees by making it
illegal for Technotron to use its new technology? Most people who live
in market-oriented economies would oppose trying to block better
products that lower the cost of services. Certainly, there is a case for
society providing temporary support and assistance for those who find
themselves without work. Many would argue for government support of
programs that encourage retraining and acquiring additional skills.
Government might also support research and development efforts, so that
other firms may find ways of outdoing Technotron. Blocking the new
technology altogether, however, seems like a mistake. After all, few
people would advocate giving up electricity because it caused so much
disruption to the kerosene and candle business. Few would suggest
holding back on improvements in medical technology because they might
cause companies selling leeches and snake oil to lose money. In short,
most people view disruptions due to technological change as a necessary
cost that is worth bearing.

Now, imagine that Technotron's new "technology" is as simple as this:
the company imports what it sells from another country. In other words,
think of foreign trade as a type of innovative technology. The objective
situation is now exactly the same as before. Because of Technotron's new
technology---which in this case is importing goods from another
county---other firms in this industry will lose money and lay off
workers. Just as it would have been inappropriate and ultimately foolish
to respond to the disruptions of new scientific technology by trying to
shut it down, it would be inappropriate and ultimately foolish to
respond to the disruptions of international trade by trying to restrict
trade.

Some workers and firms will suffer because of international trade. In a
living, breathing market-oriented economy, some workers and firms will
always be experiencing disruptions, for a wide variety of reasons.
Corporate management can be better or worse. Workers for a certain firm
can be more or less productive. Tough domestic competitors can create
just as much disruption as tough foreign competitors. Sometimes a new
product is a hit with consumers; sometimes it is a flop. Sometimes a
company is blessed by a run of good luck or stricken with a run of bad
luck. For some firms, international trade will offer great opportunities
for expanding productivity and jobs; for other firms, trade will impose
stress and pain. The disruption caused by international trade is not
fundamentally different from all the other disruptions caused by the
other workings of a market economy.

In other words, the economic analysis of free trade does not rely on a
belief that foreign trade is not disruptive or does not pose tradeoffs;
indeed, the story of Technotron begins with a particular disruptive
market change---a new technology---that causes real tradeoffs. In
thinking about the disruptions of foreign trade, or any of the other
possible costs and tradeoffs of foreign trade discussed in this chapter,
the best public policy solutions typically do not involve protectionism,
but instead involve finding ways for public policy to address the
particular issues resulting from these disruptions, costs, and
tradeoffs, while still allowing the benefits of international trade to
occur.

#### Bring It Home {#bring-it-home .Heading3Grey}

##### What's the Downside of Protection? {#whats-the-downside-of-protection .Heading4Grey}

The domestic flat-panel display industry employed many workers before
the ITC imposed the dumping margin tax. Flat-panel displays make up a
significant portion of the cost of producing laptop computers---as much
as 50%. Therefore, the antidumping tax would substantially increase the
cost, and thus the price, of U.S.-manufactured laptops. As a result of
the ITC's decision, Apple moved its domestic manufacturing plant for
Macintosh computers to Ireland (where it had an existing plant). Toshiba
shut down its U.S. manufacturing plant for laptops. And IBM cancelled
plans to open a laptop manufacturing plant in North Carolina, instead
deciding to expand production at its plant in Japan. In this case,
rather than having the desired effect of protecting U.S. interests and
giving domestic manufacturing an advantage over items manufactured
elsewhere, it had the unintended effect of driving the manufacturing
completely out of the country. Many people lost their jobs and most
flat-panel display production now occurs in countries other than the
United States.
