## 14.4 Bilateral Monopoly

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to explain:

-   How firms determine wages and employment when a specific labor
    market combines a union and a monopsony

What happens when there is market power on both sides of the labor
market, in other words, when a union meets a monopsony? Economists call
such a situation a bilateral monopoly.

Figure 14.14 Bilateral Monopoly Employment, L\*, will be lower in a
bilateral monopoly than in a competitive labor market, but the
equilibrium wage is indeterminate, somewhere in the range between Wu,
what the union would choose, and Wm, what the monopsony would choose.

[Figure 14.14](#fs-4465) is a combination of Figure 14.6 and Figure
14.11. A monopsony wants to reduce wages as well as employment, Wm and
L\* in the figure. A union wants to increase wages, but at the cost of
lower employment, Wu and L\* in the figure. Since both sides want to
reduce employment, we can be sure that the outcome will be lower
employment compared to a competitive labor market. What happens to the
wage, though, is based on the monopsonist's relative bargaining power
compared to the bargaining power of the union. The actual outcome is
indeterminate in the graph, but it will be closer to Wu if the union has
more power and closer to Wm if the monopsonist has more power.
