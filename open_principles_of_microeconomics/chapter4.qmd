### 4.1 Demand and Supply at Work in Labor Markets

#### Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

-   Predict shifts in the demand and supply curves of the labor market
-   Explain the impact of new technology on the demand and supply curves
    of the labor market
-   Explain price floors in the labor market such as minimum wage or a
    living wage

Markets for labor have demand and supply curves, just like markets for
goods. The law of demand applies in labor markets this way: A higher
salary or wage---that is, a higher price in the labor market---leads to
a decrease in the quantity of labor demanded by employers, while a lower
salary or wage leads to an increase in the quantity of labor demanded.
The law of supply functions in labor markets, too: A higher price for
labor leads to a higher quantity of labor supplied; a lower price leads
to a lower quantity supplied.

#### Equilibrium in the Labor Market

In 2020, nearly 41,000 registered nurses worked in the Minneapolis-St.
Paul-Bloomington, Minnesota-Wisconsin metropolitan area, according to
the BLS. They worked for a variety of employers: hospitals, doctors'
offices, schools, health clinics, and nursing homes. [Figure
4.2](#CNX_Econ_C04_001) illustrates how demand and supply determine
equilibrium in this labor market. The demand and supply schedules in
[Table 4.1](#Table_04_01) list the quantity supplied and quantity
demanded of nurses at different salaries.

Figure 4.2 Labor Market Example: Demand and Supply for Nurses in
Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington The demand curve (D) of those employers
who want to hire nurses intersects with the supply curve (S) of those
who are qualified and willing to work as nurses at the equilibrium point
(E). The equilibrium salary is \$85,000 and the equilibrium quantity is
41,000 nurses. At an above-equilibrium salary of \$90,000, quantity
supplied increases to 45,000, but the quantity of nurses demanded at the
higher pay declines to 40,000. At this above-equilibrium salary, an
excess supply or surplus of nurses would exist. At a below-equilibrium
salary of \$75,000, quantity supplied declines to 34,000, while the
quantity demanded at the lower wage increases to 47,000 nurses. At this
below-equilibrium salary, excess demand or a shortage exists.

Table 4.1 Demand and Supply of Nurses in Minneapolis-St.
Paul-Bloomington

The horizontal axis shows the quantity of nurses hired. In this example
we measure labor by number of workers, but another common way to measure
the quantity of labor is by the number of hours worked. The vertical
axis shows the price for nurses' labor---that is, how much they are
paid. In the real world, this "price" would be total labor compensation:
salary plus benefits. It is not obvious, but benefits are a significant
part (as high as 30 percent) of labor compensation. In this example we
measure the price of labor by salary on an annual basis, although in
other cases we could measure the price of labor by monthly or weekly
pay, or even the wage paid per hour. As the salary for nurses rises, the
quantity demanded will fall. Some hospitals and nursing homes may reduce
the number of nurses they hire, or they may lay off some of their
existing nurses, rather than pay them higher salaries. Employers who
face higher nurses' salaries may also try to replace some nursing
functions by investing in physical equipment, like computer monitoring
and diagnostic systems to monitor patients, or by using lower-paid
health care aides to reduce the number of nurses they need.

As the salary for nurses rises, the quantity supplied will rise. If
nurses' salaries in Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington are higher than in
other cities, more nurses will move to Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington
to find jobs, more people will be willing to train as nurses, and those
currently trained as nurses will be more likely to pursue nursing as a
full-time job. In other words, there will be more nurses looking for
jobs in the area.

At equilibrium, the quantity supplied and the quantity demanded are
equal. Thus, every employer who wants to hire a nurse at this
equilibrium wage can find a willing worker, and every nurse who wants to
work at this equilibrium salary can find a job. In [Figure
4.2](#CNX_Econ_C04_001), the supply curve (S) and demand curve (D)
intersect at the equilibrium point (E). The equilibrium quantity of
nurses in the Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington area is 41,000, and the
equilibrium salary is \$86,000 per year. This example simplifies the
nursing market by focusing on the "average" nurse. In reality, of
course, the market for nurses actually comprises many smaller markets,
like markets for nurses with varying degrees of experience and
credentials. Many markets contain closely related products that differ
in quality. For instance, even a simple product like gasoline comes in
regular, premium, and super-premium, each with a different price. Even
in such cases, discussing the average price of gasoline, like the
average salary for nurses, can still be useful because it reflects what
is happening in most of the submarkets.

When the price of labor is not at the equilibrium, economic incentives
tend to move salaries toward the equilibrium. For example, if salaries
for nurses in Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington were above the
equilibrium at \$90,000 per year, then 43,000 people want to work as
nurses, but employers want to hire only 39,000 nurses. At that
above-equilibrium salary, excess supply or a surplus results. In a
situation of excess supply in the labor market, with many applicants for
every job opening, employers will have an incentive to offer lower wages
than they otherwise would have. Nurses' salary will move down toward
equilibrium.

In contrast, if the salary is below the equilibrium at, say, \$60,000
per year, then a situation of excess demand or a shortage arises. In
this case, employers encouraged by the relatively lower wage want to
hire 40,000 nurses, but only 27,000 individuals want to work as nurses
at that salary in Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington. In response to the
shortage, some employers will offer higher pay to attract the nurses.
Other employers will have to match the higher pay to keep their own
employees. The higher salaries will encourage more nurses to train or
work in Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington. Again, price and quantity in
the labor market will move toward equilibrium.

#### Shifts in Labor Demand

The demand curve for labor shows the quantity of labor employers wish to
hire at any given salary or wage rate, under the *ceteris paribus*
assumption. A change in the wage or salary will result in a change in
the quantity demanded of labor. If the wage rate increases, employers
will want to hire fewer employees. The quantity of labor demanded will
decrease, and there will be a movement upward along the demand curve. If
the wages and salaries decrease, employers are more likely to hire a
greater number of workers. The quantity of labor demanded will increase,
resulting in a downward movement along the demand curve.

Shifts in the demand curve for labor occur for many reasons. One key
reason is that the demand for labor is based on the demand for the good
or service that is produced. For example, the more new automobiles
consumers demand, the greater the number of workers automakers will need
to hire. Therefore the demand for labor is called a "derived demand."
Here are some examples of derived demand for labor:

-   The demand for chefs is dependent on the demand for restaurant
    meals.
-   The demand for pharmacists is dependent on the demand for
    prescription drugs.
-   The demand for attorneys is dependent on the demand for legal
    services.

As the demand for the goods and services increases, the demand for labor
will increase, or shift to the right, to meet employers' production
requirements. As the demand for the goods and services decreases, the
demand for labor will decrease, or shift to the left. [Table
4.2](#Table_04_02) shows that in addition to the derived demand for
labor, demand can also increase or decrease (shift) in response to
several factors.

Table 4.2 Factors That Can Shift Demand

"Trends and Challenges for Work in the 21^st^ Century."

#### Shifts in Labor Supply

The supply of labor is upward-sloping and adheres to the law of supply:
The higher the price, the greater the quantity supplied and the lower
the price, the less quantity supplied. The supply curve models the
tradeoff between supplying labor into the market or using time in
leisure activities at every given price level. The higher the wage, the
more labor is willing to work and forego leisure activities. [Table
4.3](#Table_04_03) lists some of the factors that will cause the supply
to increase or decrease.

Table 4.3 Factors that Can Shift Supply

A change in salary will lead to a movement along labor demand or labor
supply curves, but it will not shift those curves. However, other events
like those we have outlined here will cause either the demand or the
supply of labor to shift, and thus will move the labor market to a new
equilibrium salary and quantity.

#### Technology and Wage Inequality: The Four-Step Process

Economic events can change the equilibrium salary (or wage) and quantity
of labor. Consider how the wave of new information technologies, like
computer and telecommunications networks, has affected low-skill and
high-skill workers in the U.S. economy. From the perspective of
employers who demand labor, these new technologies are often a
substitute for low-skill laborers like file clerks who used to keep file
cabinets full of paper records of transactions. However, the same new
technologies are a complement to high-skill workers like managers, who
benefit from the technological advances by having the ability to monitor
more information, communicate more easily, and juggle a wider array of
responsibilities. How will the new technologies affect the wages of
high-skill and low-skill workers? For this question, the four-step
process of analyzing how shifts in supply or demand affect a market
(introduced in [Demand and
Supply](http://openstax.org/books/principles-microeconomics-3e/pages/3-introduction-to-demand-and-supply))
works in this way:

Step 1. What did the markets for low-skill labor and high-skill labor
look like before the arrival of the new technologies? In [Figure
4.3](#CNX_Econ_C04_009) (a) and [Figure 4.3](#CNX_Econ_C04_009) (b),
S~0~ is the original supply curve for labor and D~0~ is the original
demand curve for labor in each market. In each graph, the original point
of equilibrium, E~0~, occurs at the price W~0~ and the quantity Q~0~.

![](media/4-1-demand-and-supply-at-work-in-labor-markets_rId39.jpeg){width="6.5in" height="2.855in"}

Figure 4.3 Technology and Wages: Applying Demand and Supply (a) The
demand for low-skill labor shifts to the left when technology can do the
job previously done by these workers. (b) New technologies can also
increase the demand for high-skill labor in fields such as information
technology and network administration.

Step 2. Does the new technology affect the supply of labor from
households or the demand for labor from firms? The technology change
described here affects demand for labor by firms that hire workers.

Step 3. Will the new technology increase or decrease demand? Based on
the description earlier, as the substitute for low-skill labor becomes
available, demand for low-skill labor will shift to the left, from D~0~
to D~1~. As the technology complement for high-skill labor becomes
cheaper, demand for high-skill labor will shift to the right, from D~0~
to D~1~.

Step 4. The new equilibrium for low-skill labor, shown as point E~1~
with price W~1~ and quantity Q~1~, has a lower wage and quantity hired
than the original equilibrium, E~0~. The new equilibrium for high-skill
labor, shown as point E~1~ with price W~1~ and quantity Q~1~, has a
higher wage and quantity hired than the original equilibrium (E~0~).

Thus, the demand and supply model predicts that the new computer and
communications technologies will raise the pay of high-skill workers but
reduce the pay of low-skill workers. From the 1970s to the mid-2000s,
the wage gap widened between high-skill and low-skill labor. According
to the National Center for Education Statistics, in 1980, for example, a
college graduate earned about 30% more than a high school graduate with
comparable job experience, but by 2019, a college graduate earned about
59% more than an otherwise comparable high school graduate. Many
economists believe that the trend toward greater wage inequality across
the U.S. economy is due to improvements in technology.

#### Price Floors in the Labor Market: Living Wages and Minimum Wages

In contrast to goods and services markets, price ceilings are rare in
labor markets, because rules that prevent people from earning income are
not politically popular. There is one exception: boards of trustees or
stockholders, as an example, propose limits on the high incomes of top
business executives.

The labor market, however, presents some prominent examples of price
floors, which are an attempt to increase the wages of low-paid workers.
The U.S. government sets a minimum wage, a price floor that makes it
illegal for an employer to pay employees less than a certain hourly
rate. In mid-2009, the U.S. minimum wage was raised to \$7.25 per hour.
Local political movements in a number of U.S. cities have pushed for a
higher minimum wage, which they call a living wage. Promoters of living
wage laws maintain that the minimum wage is too low to ensure a
reasonable standard of living. They base this conclusion on the
calculation that, if you work 40 hours a week at a minimum wage of
\$7.25 per hour for 50 weeks a year, your annual income is \$14,500,
which is less than the official U.S. government definition of what it
means for a family to be in poverty. (A family with two adults earning
minimum wage and two young children will find it more cost efficient for
one parent to provide childcare while the other works for income. Thus
the family income would be \$14,500, which is significantly lower than
the federal poverty line for a family of four, which was \$26,500 in
2021.)

Supporters of the living wage argue that full-time workers should be
assured a high enough wage so that they can afford the essentials of
life: food, clothing, shelter, and healthcare. Since Baltimore passed
the first living wage law in 1994, several dozen cities enacted similar
laws in the late 1990s and the 2000s. The living wage ordinances do not
apply to all employers, but they have specified that all employees of
the city or employees of firms that the city hires be paid at least a
certain wage that is usually a few dollars per hour above the U.S.
minimum wage.

[Figure 4.4](#CNX_Econ_C04_004) illustrates the situation of a city
considering a living wage law. For simplicity, we assume that there is
no federal minimum wage. The wage appears on the vertical axis, because
the wage is the price in the labor market. Before the passage of the
living wage law, the equilibrium wage is \$10 per hour and the city
hires 1,200 workers at this wage. However, a group of concerned citizens
persuades the city council to enact a living wage law requiring
employers to pay no less than \$12 per hour. In response to the higher
wage, 1,600 workers look for jobs with the city. At this higher wage,
the city, as an employer, is willing to hire only 700 workers. At the
price floor, the quantity supplied exceeds the quantity demanded, and a
surplus of labor exists in this market. For workers who continue to have
a job at a higher salary, life has improved. For those who were willing
to work at the old wage rate but lost their jobs with the wage increase,
life has not improved. [Table 4.4](#Table_04_04) shows the differences
in supply and demand at different wages.

![](media/4-1-demand-and-supply-at-work-in-labor-markets_rId48.jpeg){width="3.25in" height="2.49in"}

Figure 4.4 A Living Wage: Example of a Price Floor The original
equilibrium in this labor market is a wage of \$10/hour and a quantity
of 1,200 workers, shown at point E. Imposing a wage floor at \$12/hour
leads to an excess supply of labor. At that wage, the quantity of labor
supplied is 1,600 and the quantity of labor demanded is only 700.

Table 4.4 Living Wage: Example of a Price Floor

#### The Minimum Wage as an Example of a Price Floor

The U.S. minimum wage is a price floor that is set either very close to
the equilibrium wage or even slightly below it. About 1.5% of hourly
workers in the U.S. are paid the minimum wage. In other words, the vast
majority of the U.S. labor force has its wages determined in the labor
market, not as a result of the government price floor. However, for
workers with low skills and little experience, like those without a high
school diploma or teenagers, the minimum wage is quite important. In
many cities, the federal minimum wage is apparently below the market
price for unskilled labor, because employers offer more than the minimum
wage to checkout clerks and other low-skill workers without any
government prodding.

Economists have attempted to estimate how much the minimum wage reduces
the quantity demanded of low-skill labor. A typical result of such
studies is that a 10% increase in the minimum wage would decrease the
hiring of unskilled workers by 1 to 2%, which seems a relatively small
reduction. In fact, some studies have even found no effect of a higher
minimum wage on employment at certain times and places---although these
studies are controversial. Well-known economists Walter Williams and
Thomas Sowell, who both focus on the intersections of race and
economics, argue that minimum wages increase discrimination and limit
economic mobility. Williams, for example, indicates that higher minimum
wages would increase employment barriers for lower-skilled workers,
reducing the opportunity for them to learn on the job and gain
experience that would give them more choice in employment.

Let's suppose that the minimum wage lies just slightly *below* the
equilibrium wage level. Wages could fluctuate according to market forces
above this price floor, but they would not be allowed to move beneath
the floor. In this situation, the price floor minimum wage is
*nonbinding* ---that is, the price floor is not determining the market
outcome. Even if the minimum wage moves just a little higher, it will
still have no effect on the quantity of employment in the economy, as
long as it remains below the equilibrium wage. Even if the government
increases the minimum wage by enough so that it rises slightly above the
equilibrium wage and becomes binding, there will be only a small excess
supply gap between the quantity demanded and quantity supplied.

These insights help to explain why U.S. minimum wage laws have
historically had only a small impact on employment. Since the minimum
wage has typically been set close to the equilibrium wage for low-skill
labor and sometimes even below it, it has not had a large effect in
creating an excess supply of labor. However, if the minimum wage
increased dramatically---say, if it doubled to match the living wages
that some U.S. cities have considered---then its impact on reducing the
quantity demanded of employment would be far greater. The following
Clear It Up feature describes in greater detail some of the arguments
for and against changes to the minimum wage.

#### Clear It Up {#clear-it-up .Heading3Grey}

##### What's the harm in raising the minimum wage? {#whats-the-harm-in-raising-the-minimum-wage .Heading4Grey}

Because of the law of demand, a higher required wage will reduce the
amount of low-skill employment either in terms of employees or in terms
of work hours. Although there is controversy over the numbers, let's say
for the sake of the argument that a 10% rise in the minimum wage will
reduce the employment of low-skill workers by 2%. Does this outcome mean
that raising the minimum wage by 10% is bad public policy? Not
necessarily.

If 98% of those receiving the minimum wage have a pay increase of 10%,
but 2% of those receiving the minimum wage lose their jobs, are the
gains for society as a whole greater than the losses? The answer is not
clear, because job losses, even for a small group, may cause more pain
than modest income gains for others. For one thing, we need to consider
which minimum wage workers are losing their jobs. If the 2% of minimum
wage workers who lose their jobs are struggling to support families,
that is one thing. If those who lose their job are high school students
picking up spending money over summer vacation, that is something else.

Another complexity is that many minimum wage workers do not work
full-time for an entire year. Imagine a minimum wage worker who holds
different part-time jobs for a few months at a time, with bouts of
unemployment in between. The worker in this situation receives the 10%
raise in the minimum wage when working, but also ends up working 2%
fewer hours during the year because the higher minimum wage reduces how
much employers want people to work. Overall, this worker's income would
rise because the 10% pay raise would more than offset the 2% fewer hours
worked.

Of course, these arguments do not prove that raising the minimum wage is
necessarily a good idea either. There may well be other, better public
policy options for helping low-wage workers. (The [Poverty and Economic
Inequality](http://openstax.org/books/principles-microeconomics-3e/pages/15-introduction-to-poverty-and-economic-inequality)
chapter discusses some possibilities.) The lesson from this maze of
minimum wage arguments is that complex social problems rarely have
simple answers. Even those who agree on how a proposed economic policy
affects quantity demanded and quantity supplied may still disagree on
whether the policy is a good idea.


### 4.2 Demand and Supply in Financial Markets

#### Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

-   Identify the demanders and suppliers in a financial market
-   Explain how interest rates can affect supply and demand
-   Analyze the economic effects of U.S. debt in terms of domestic
    financial markets
-   Explain the role of price ceilings and usury laws in the U.S.

United States\' households, institutions, and domestic businesses saved
almost \$1.3 trillion in 2015. Where did that savings go and how was it
used? Some of the savings ended up in banks, which in turn loaned the
money to individuals or businesses that wanted to borrow money. Some was
invested in private companies or loaned to government agencies that
wanted to borrow money to raise funds for purposes like building roads
or mass transit. Some firms reinvested their savings in their own
businesses.

In this section, we will determine how the demand and supply model links
those who wish to supply financial capital (i.e., savings) with those
who demand financial capital (i.e., borrowing). Those who save money (or
make financial investments, which is the same thing), whether
individuals or businesses, are on the supply side of the financial
market. Those who borrow money are on the demand side of the financial
market. For a more detailed treatment of the different kinds of
financial investments like bank accounts, stocks and bonds, see the
[Financial
Markets](http://openstax.org/books/principles-microeconomics-3e/pages/17-introduction-to-financial-markets)
chapter.

#### Who Demands and Who Supplies in Financial Markets?

In any market, the price is what suppliers receive and what demanders
pay. In financial markets, those who supply financial capital through
saving expect to receive a rate of return, while those who demand
financial capital by receiving funds expect to pay a rate of return.
This rate of return can come in a variety of forms, depending on the
type of investment.

The simplest example of a rate of return is the interest rate. For
example, when you supply money into a savings account at a bank, you
receive interest on your deposit. The interest the bank pays you as a
percent of your deposits is the interest rate. Similarly, if you demand
a loan to buy a car or a computer, you will need to pay interest on the
money you borrow.

Let's consider the market for borrowing money with credit cards. In
2021, almost 200 million Americans were cardholders. Credit cards allow
you to borrow money from the card\'s issuer, and pay back the borrowed
amount plus interest, although most allow you a period of time in which
you can repay the loan without paying interest. A typical credit card
interest rate ranges from 12% to 18% per year. In May 2021, Americans
had about \$807 billion outstanding in credit card debts. As of 2021,
just over 45% of American families carried some credit card debt. Let's
say that, on average, the annual interest rate for credit card borrowing
is 15% per year. Thus, Americans pay tens of billions of dollars every
year in interest on their credit cards---plus basic fees for the credit
card or fees for late payments.

[Figure 4.5](#CNX_Econ_C04_005) illustrates demand and supply in the
financial market for credit cards. The horizontal axis of the financial
market shows the quantity of money loaned or borrowed in this market.
The vertical or price axis shows the rate of return, which in the case
of credit card borrowing we can measure with an interest rate. [Table
4.5](#Table_04_05) shows the quantity of financial capital that
consumers demand at various interest rates and the quantity that credit
card firms (often banks) are willing to supply.

![](media/4-2-demand-and-supply-in-financial-markets_rId25.jpeg){width="4.88in" height="2.53in"}

Figure 4.5 Demand and Supply for Borrowing Money with Credit Cards In
this market for credit card borrowing, the demand curve (D) for
borrowing financial capital intersects the supply curve (S) for lending
financial capital at equilibrium E. At the equilibrium, the interest
rate (the "price" in this market) is 15% and the quantity of financial
capital loaned and borrowed is \$600 billion. The equilibrium price is
where the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied are equal. At an
above-equilibrium interest rate like 21%, the quantity of financial
capital supplied would increase to \$750 billion, but the quantity
demanded would decrease to \$480 billion. At a below-equilibrium
interest rate like 13%, the quantity of financial capital demanded would
increase to \$700 billion, but the quantity of financial capital
supplied would decrease to \$510 billion.

Table 4.5 Demand and Supply for Borrowing Money with Credit Cards

The laws of demand and supply continue to apply in the financial
markets. According to the law of demand, a higher rate of return (that
is, a higher price) will decrease the quantity demanded. As the interest
rate rises, consumers will reduce the quantity that they borrow.
According to the law of supply, a higher price increases the quantity
supplied. Consequently, as the interest rate paid on credit card
borrowing rises, more firms will be eager to issue credit cards and to
encourage customers to use them. Conversely, if the interest rate on
credit cards falls, the quantity of financial capital supplied in the
credit card market will decrease and the quantity demanded will
increase.

#### Equilibrium in Financial Markets

In the financial market for credit cards in [Figure
4.5](#CNX_Econ_C04_005), the supply curve (S) and the demand curve (D)
cross at the equilibrium point (E). The equilibrium occurs at an
interest rate of 15%, where the quantity of funds demanded and the
quantity supplied are equal at an equilibrium quantity of \$600 billion.

If the interest rate (remember, this measures the "price" in the
financial market) is above the equilibrium level, then an excess supply,
or a surplus, of financial capital will arise in this market. For
example, at an interest rate of 21%, the quantity of funds supplied
increases to \$750 billion, while the quantity demanded decreases to
\$480 billion. At this above-equilibrium interest rate, firms are eager
to supply loans to credit card borrowers, but relatively few people or
businesses wish to borrow. As a result, some credit card firms will
lower the interest rates (or other fees) they charge to attract more
business. This strategy will push the interest rate down toward the
equilibrium level.

If the interest rate is below the equilibrium, then excess demand or a
shortage of funds occurs in this market. At an interest rate of 13%, the
quantity of funds credit card borrowers demand increases to \$700
billion, but the quantity credit card firms are willing to supply is
only \$510 billion. In this situation, credit card firms will perceive
that they are overloaded with eager borrowers and conclude that they
have an opportunity to raise interest rates or fees. The interest rate
will face economic pressures to creep up toward the equilibrium level.

The FRED database publishes some two dozen measures of interest rates,
including interest rates on credit cards, automobile loans, personal
loans, mortgage loans, and more. You can find these at the FRED
[website](https://openstax.org/l/FRED_stlouis).

#### Shifts in Demand and Supply in Financial Markets

Those who supply financial capital face two broad decisions: how much to
save, and how to divide up their savings among different forms of
financial investments. We will discuss each of these in turn.

Participants in financial markets must decide when they prefer to
consume goods: now or in the future. Economists call this intertemporal
decision making because it involves decisions across time. Unlike a
decision about what to buy from the grocery store, people make
investment or savings decisions across a period of time, sometimes a
long period.

Most workers save for retirement because their income in the present is
greater than their needs, while the opposite will be true once they
retire. Thus, they save today and supply financial markets. If their
income increases, they save more. If their perceived situation in the
future changes, they change the amount of their saving. For example,
there is some evidence that Social Security, the program that workers
pay into in order to qualify for government checks after retirement, has
tended to reduce the quantity of financial capital that workers save. If
this is true, Social Security has shifted the supply of financial
capital at any interest rate to the left.

By contrast, many college students need money today when their income is
low (or nonexistent) to pay their college expenses. As a result, they
borrow today and demand from financial markets. Once they graduate and
become employed, they will pay back the loans. Individuals borrow money
to purchase homes or cars. A business seeks financial investment so that
it has the funds to build a factory or invest in a research and
development project that will not pay off for five years, ten years, or
even more. Thus, when consumers and businesses have greater confidence
that they will be able to repay in the future, the quantity demanded of
financial capital at any given interest rate will shift to the right.

For example, in the technology boom of the late 1990s, many businesses
became extremely confident that investments in new technology would have
a high rate of return, and their demand for financial capital shifted to
the right. Conversely, during the 2008 and 2009 Great Recession, their
demand for financial capital at any given interest rate shifted to the
left.

To this point, we have been looking at saving in total. Now let us
consider what affects saving in different types of financial
investments. In deciding between different forms of financial
investments, suppliers of financial capital will have to consider the
rates of return and the risks involved. Rate of return is a positive
attribute of investments, but risk is a negative. If Investment A
becomes more risky, or the return diminishes, then savers will shift
their funds to Investment B---and the supply curve of financial capital
for Investment A will shift back to the left while the supply curve of
capital for Investment B shifts to the right.

#### The United States as a Global Borrower

In the global economy, trillions of dollars of financial investment
cross national borders every year. In the early 2000s, financial
investors from foreign countries were investing several hundred billion
dollars per year more in the U.S. economy than U.S. financial investors
were investing abroad. The following Work It Out deals with one of the
macroeconomic concerns for the U.S. economy in recent years.

#### Work It Out {#work-it-out .Heading3Grey}

##### The Effect of Growing U.S. Debt {#the-effect-of-growing-u.s.-debt .Heading4Grey}

Imagine that foreign investors viewed the U.S. economy as a less
desirable place to put their money because of fears about the growth of
the U.S. public debt. Using the four-step process for analyzing how
changes in supply and demand affect equilibrium outcomes, how would
increased U.S. public debt affect the equilibrium price and quantity for
capital in U.S. financial markets?

Step 1. Draw a diagram showing demand and supply for financial capital
that represents the original scenario in which foreign investors are
pouring money into the U.S. economy. [Figure 4.6](#CNX_Econ_C04_014)
shows a demand curve, D, and a supply curve, S, where the supply of
capital includes the funds arriving from foreign investors. The original
equilibrium E~0~ occurs at interest rate R~0~ and quantity of financial
investment Q~0~.

Figure 4.6 The United States as a Global Borrower Before U.S. Debt
Uncertainty The graph shows the demand for financial capital from and
supply of financial capital into the U.S. financial markets by the
foreign sector before the increase in uncertainty regarding U.S. public
debt. The original equilibrium (E~0~) occurs at an equilibrium rate of
return (R~0~) and the equilibrium quantity is at Q~0~.

Step 2. Will the diminished confidence in the U.S. economy as a place to
invest affect demand or supply of financial capital? Yes, it will affect
supply. Many foreign investors look to the U.S. financial markets to
store their money in safe financial vehicles with low risk and stable
returns. Diminished confidence means U.S. financial assets will be seen
as more risky.

Step 3. Will supply increase or decrease? When the enthusiasm of foreign
investors' for investing their money in the U.S. economy diminishes, the
supply of financial capital shifts to the left. [Figure
4.7](#CNX_Econ_C04_006) shows the supply curve shift from S~0~ to S~1~.

![](media/4-2-demand-and-supply-in-financial-markets_rId40.jpeg){width="3.25in" height="2.535in"}

Figure 4.7 The United States as a Global Borrower Before and After U.S.
Debt Uncertainty The graph shows the demand for financial capital and
supply of financial capital into the U.S. financial markets by the
foreign sector before and after the increase in uncertainty regarding
U.S. public debt. The original equilibrium (E~0~) occurs at an
equilibrium rate of return (R~0~) and the equilibrium quantity is at
Q~0~.

Step 4. Thus, foreign investors' diminished enthusiasm leads to a new
equilibrium, E~1~, which occurs at the higher interest rate, R~1~, and
the lower quantity of financial investment, Q~1~. In short, U.S.
borrowers will have to pay more interest on their borrowing.

The economy has experienced an enormous inflow of foreign capital.
According to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, by the third quarter
of 2021, U.S. investors had accumulated \$34.45 trillion of foreign
assets, but foreign investors owned a total of \$50.53 trillion of U.S.
assets. If foreign investors were to pull their money out of the U.S.
economy and invest elsewhere in the world, the result could be a
significantly lower quantity of financial investment in the United
States, available only at a higher interest rate. This reduced inflow of
foreign financial investment could impose hardship on U.S. consumers and
firms interested in borrowing.

In a modern, developed economy, financial capital often moves invisibly
through electronic transfers between one bank account and another. Yet
we can analyze these flows of funds with the same tools of demand and
supply as markets for goods or labor.

#### Price Ceilings in Financial Markets: Usury Laws

As we noted earlier, about 200 million Americans own credit cards, and
their interest payments and fees total tens of billions of dollars each
year. It is little wonder that political pressures sometimes arise for
setting limits on the interest rates or fees that credit card companies
charge. The firms that issue credit cards, including banks, oil
companies, phone companies, and retail stores, respond that the higher
interest rates are necessary to cover the losses created by those who
borrow on their credit cards and who do not repay on time or at all.
These companies also point out that cardholders can avoid paying
interest if they pay their bills on time.

Consider the credit card market as [Figure 4.8](#CNX_Econ_C04_007)
illustrates. In this financial market, the vertical axis shows the
interest rate (which is the price in the financial market). Demanders in
the credit card market are households and businesses. Suppliers are the
companies that issue credit cards. This figure does not use specific
numbers, which would be hypothetical in any case, but instead focuses on
the underlying economic relationships. Imagine a law imposes a price
ceiling that holds the interest rate charged on credit cards at the rate
Rc, which lies below the interest rate R~0~ that would otherwise have
prevailed in the market. The horizontal dashed line at interest rate
R~c~ in [Figure 4.8](#CNX_Econ_C04_007) shows the price ceiling. The
demand and supply model predicts that at the lower price ceiling
interest rate, the quantity demanded of credit card debt will increase
from its original level of Q~0~ to Qd; however, the quantity supplied of
credit card debt will decrease from the original Q~0~ to Qs. At the
price ceiling (Rc), quantity demanded will exceed quantity supplied.
Consequently, a number of people who want to have credit cards and are
willing to pay the prevailing interest rate will find that companies are
unwilling to issue cards to them. The result will be a credit shortage.

![](media/4-2-demand-and-supply-in-financial-markets_rId46.jpeg){width="3.25in" height="2.52in"}

Figure 4.8 Credit Card Interest Rates: Another Price Ceiling Example The
original intersection of demand D and supply S occurs at equilibrium
E~0~. However, a price ceiling is set at the interest rate Rc, below the
equilibrium interest rate R~0~, and so the interest rate cannot adjust
upward to the equilibrium. At the price ceiling, the quantity demanded,
Qd, exceeds the quantity supplied, Qs. There is excess demand, also
called a shortage.

Many states do have usury laws, which impose an upper limit on the
interest rate that lenders can charge. However, in many cases these
upper limits are well above the market interest rate. For example, if
the interest rate is not allowed to rise above 30% per year, it can
still fluctuate below that level according to market forces. A price
ceiling that is set at a relatively high level is nonbinding, and it
will have no practical effect unless the equilibrium price soars high
enough to exceed the price ceiling.


### 4.3 The Market System as an Efficient Mechanism for Information

#### Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

-   Apply demand and supply models to analyze prices and quantities
-   Explain the effects of price controls on the equilibrium of prices
    and quantities

Prices exist in markets for goods and services, for labor, and for
financial capital. In all of these markets, prices serve as a remarkable
social mechanism for collecting, combining, and transmitting information
that is relevant to the market---namely, the relationship between demand
and supply---and then serving as messengers to convey that information
to buyers and sellers. In a market-oriented economy, no government
agency or guiding intelligence oversees the set of responses and
interconnections that result from a change in price. Instead, each
consumer reacts according to that person's preferences and budget set,
and each profit-seeking producer reacts to the impact on its expected
profits. The following Clear It Up feature examines the demand and
supply models.

#### Clear It Up {#clear-it-up .Heading3Grey}

##### Why are demand and supply curves important? {#why-are-demand-and-supply-curves-important .Heading4Grey}

The demand and supply model is the second fundamental diagram for this
course. (The opportunity set model that we introduced in the [Choice in
a World of
Scarcity](http://openstax.org/books/principles-microeconomics-3e/pages/2-introduction-to-choice-in-a-world-of-scarcity)
chapter was the first.) Just as it would be foolish to try to learn the
arithmetic of long division by memorizing every possible combination of
numbers that can be divided by each other, it would be foolish to try to
memorize every specific example of demand and supply in this chapter,
this textbook, or this course. Demand and supply is not primarily a list
of examples. It is a model to analyze prices and quantities. Even though
demand and supply diagrams have many labels, they are fundamentally the
same in their logic. Your goal should be to understand the underlying
model so you can use it to analyze *any* market.

[Figure 4.9](#CNX_Econ_C04_008) displays a generic demand and supply
curve. The horizontal axis shows the different measures of quantity: a
quantity of a good or service, or a quantity of labor for a given job,
or a quantity of financial capital. The vertical axis shows a measure of
price: the price of a good or service, the wage in the labor market, or
the rate of return (like the interest rate) in the financial market.

The demand and supply model can explain the existing levels of prices,
wages, and rates of return. To carry out such an analysis, think about
the quantity that will be demanded at each price and the quantity that
will be supplied at each price---that is, think about the shape of the
demand and supply curves---and how these forces will combine to produce
equilibrium.

We can also use demand and supply to explain how economic events will
cause changes in prices, wages, and rates of return. There are only four
possibilities: the change in any single event may cause the demand curve
to shift right or to shift left, or it may cause the supply curve to
shift right or to shift left. The key to analyzing the effect of an
economic event on equilibrium prices and quantities is to determine
which of these four possibilities occurred. The way to do this correctly
is to think back to the list of factors that shift the demand and supply
curves. Note that if more than one variable is changing at the same
time, the overall impact will depend on the degree of the shifts. When
there are multiple variables, economists isolate each change and analyze
it independently.

Figure 4.9 Demand and Supply Curves The figure displays a generic demand
and supply curve. The horizontal axis shows the different measures of
quantity: a quantity of a good or service, a quantity of labor for a
given job, or a quantity of financial capital. The vertical axis shows a
measure of price: the price of a good or service, the wage in the labor
market, or the rate of return (like the interest rate) in the financial
market. We can use the demand and supply curves explain how economic
events will cause changes in prices, wages, and rates of return.

An increase in the price of some product signals consumers that there is
a shortage; therefore, they may want to economize on buying this
product. For example, if you are thinking about taking a plane trip to
Hawaii, but the ticket turns out to be expensive during the week you
intend to go, you might consider other weeks when the ticket might be
cheaper. The price could be high because you were planning to travel
during a holiday when demand for traveling is high. Maybe the cost of an
input like jet fuel increased or the airline has raised the price
temporarily to see how many people are willing to pay it. Perhaps all of
these factors are present at the same time. You do not need to analyze
the market and break down the price change into its underlying factors.
You just have to look at the ticket price and decide whether and when to
fly.

In the same way, price changes provide useful information to producers.
Imagine the situation of a farmer who grows oats and learns that the
price of oats has risen. The higher price could be due to an increase in
demand caused by a new scientific study proclaiming that eating oats is
especially healthful. Perhaps the price of a substitute grain, like
corn, has risen, and people have responded by buying more oats. The oat
farmer does not need to know the details. The farmer only needs to know
that the price of oats has risen and that it will be profitable to
expand production as a result.

The actions of individual consumers and producers as they react to
prices overlap and interlock in markets for goods, labor, and financial
capital. A change in any single market is transmitted through these
multiple interconnections to other markets. The vision of the role of
flexible prices helping markets to reach equilibrium and linking
different markets together helps to explain why price controls can be so
counterproductive. Price controls are government laws that serve to
regulate prices rather than allow the various markets to determine
prices. There is an old proverb: "Don't kill the messenger." In ancient
times, messengers carried information between distant cities and
kingdoms. When they brought bad news, there was an emotional impulse to
kill the messenger. However, killing the messenger did not kill the bad
news. Moreover, killing the messenger had an undesirable side effect:
Other messengers would refuse to bring news to that city or kingdom,
depriving its citizens of vital information.

Those who seek price controls are trying to kill the messenger---or at
least to stifle an unwelcome message that prices are bringing about the
equilibrium level of price and quantity. However, price controls do
nothing to affect the underlying forces of demand and supply, and this
can have serious repercussions. During China's "Great Leap Forward" in
the late 1950s, the government kept food prices artificially low, with
the result that 30 to 40 million people died of starvation because the
low prices depressed farm production. This was communist party leader
Mao Zedong\'s social and economic campaign to rapidly transform the
country from an agrarian economy to a socialist society through rapid
industrialization and collectivization. Changes in demand and supply
will continue to reveal themselves through consumers' and producers'
behavior. Immobilizing the price messenger through price controls will
deprive everyone in the economy of critical information. Without this
information, it becomes difficult for everyone---buyers and sellers
alike---to react in a flexible and appropriate manner as changes occur
throughout the economy.

#### Bring It Home {#bring-it-home .Heading3Grey}

##### Baby Boomers Come of Age {#baby-boomers-come-of-age .Heading4Grey}

The theory of supply and demand can explain what happens in the labor
markets and suggests that the demand for nurses will increase as
healthcare needs of baby boomers increase, as [Figure
4.10](#CNX_Econ_C04_015) shows. The impact of that increase will result
in an average salary higher than the \$75,330 earned in 2020 referenced
in the first part of this case. The new equilibrium (E~1~) will be at
the new equilibrium price (Pe~1~).Equilibrium quantity will also
increase from Qe~0~ to Qe~1~.

![](media/4-3-the-market-system-as-an-efficient-mechanism-for-information_rId29.jpeg){width="3.25in" height="2.535in"}

Figure 4.10 Impact of Increasing Demand for Nurses 2020--2030 In 2020,
the median salary for nurses was \$75,330. As demand for services
increases, the demand curve shifts to the right (from D~0~ to D~1~) and
the equilibrium quantity of nurses increases from Qe~0~ to Qe~1~. The
equilibrium salary increases from Pe~0~ to Pe~1~.

Suppose that as the demand for nurses increases, the supply shrinks due
to an increasing number of nurses entering retirement and increases in
the tuition of nursing degrees. The leftward shift of the supply curve
in [Figure 4.11](#CNX_Econ_C04_016) captures the impact of a decreasing
supply of nurses. The shifts in the two curves result in higher salaries
for nurses, but the overall impact on the quantity of nurses is
uncertain, as it depends on the relative shifts of supply and demand.

![](media/4-3-the-market-system-as-an-efficient-mechanism-for-information_rId32.jpeg){width="3.25in" height="2.535in"}

Figure 4.11 Impact of Decreasing Supply of Nurses between 2020 and 2030
The increase in demand for nurses shown in Figure 4.10 leads to both
higher prices and higher quantities demanded. As nurses retire from the
work force, the supply of nurses decreases, causing a leftward shift in
the supply curve and higher salaries for nurses at Pe~2~. The net effect
on the equilibrium quantity of nurses is uncertain, which in this
representation is less than Qe~1~, but more than the initial Qe~0~.

While we do not know if the number of nurses will increase or decrease
relative to their initial employment, we know they will have higher
salaries.

but labor markets, such as the nursing profession, can also apply to
this analysis. (Credit: modification of \"Hospital do Subúrbio\" by

### Introduction to Labor and Financial Markets

#### Bring It Home {#bring-it-home .Heading3Grey}

##### Baby Boomers Come of Age {#baby-boomers-come-of-age .Heading4Grey}

According to the 2020 Census, 22% of the U.S. population was 60 years
old or older, which means that more than 74 million people have reached
an age when they will need increased medical care.

The baby boomer population, the group born between 1946 and 1964, is
comprised of more than 71 million people who have already reached
retirement age or will soon reach retirement. As this population grows
older, they will be faced with common healthcare issues such as heart
conditions, arthritis, and Alzheimer's that may require hospitalization,
long-term, or at-home nursing care. Aging baby boomers and advances in
life-saving and life-extending technologies will increase the demand for
healthcare and nursing. Additionally, the Affordable Care Act, which
expands access to healthcare for millions of Americans, has further
increased the demand.

These data tell us, as economists, that the market for healthcare
professionals, and nurses in particular, will face several challenges.
Our study of supply and demand will help us to analyze what might happen
in the labor market for nursing and other healthcare professionals, as
we will discuss in the second half of this case at the end of the
chapter.

The theories of supply and demand do not apply just to markets for
goods. They apply to any market, even markets for things we may not
think of as goods and services like labor and financial services. Labor
markets are markets for employees or jobs. Financial services markets
are markets for saving or borrowing.

When we think about demand and supply curves in goods and services
markets, it is easy to picture the demanders and suppliers: businesses
produce the products and households buy them. Who are the demanders and
suppliers in labor and financial service markets? In labor markets job
seekers (individuals) are the suppliers of labor, while firms and other
employers who hire labor are the demanders for labor. In financial
markets, any individual or firm who saves contributes to the supply of
money, and any entity that borrows (person, firm, or government)
contributes to the demand for money.

As a college student, you most likely participate in both labor and
financial markets. Employment is a fact of life for most college
students: According to the National Center for Educational Statistics,
in 2018 43% of full-time college students and 81% of part-time college
students were employed. Most college students are also heavily involved
in financial markets, primarily as borrowers. As of the 2018--19 school
year, 43% of full-time undergraduate students were receiving loan aid to
help finance their education, and those loans averaged \$7,300 per year.
Many students also borrow for other expenses, like purchasing a car. As
this chapter will illustrate, we can analyze labor markets and financial
markets with the same tools we use to analyze demand and supply in the
goods markets.
