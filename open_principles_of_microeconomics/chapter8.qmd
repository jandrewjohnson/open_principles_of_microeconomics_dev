### 8.1 Perfect Competition and Why It Matters

#### Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

-   Explain the characteristics of a perfectly competitive market
-   Discuss how perfectly competitive firms react in the short run and
    in the long run

Firms are in perfect competition when the following conditions occur:
(1) many firms produce identical products; (2) many buyers are available
to buy the product, and many sellers are available to sell the product;
(3) sellers and buyers have all relevant information to make rational
decisions about the product that they are buying and selling; and (4)
firms can enter and leave the market without any restrictions---in other
words, there is free entry and exit into and out of the market.

A perfectly competitive firm is known as a price taker, because the
pressure of competing firms forces it to accept the prevailing
equilibrium price in the market. If a firm in a perfectly competitive
market raises the price of its product by so much as a penny, it will
lose all of its sales to competitors. When a wheat grower, as we
discussed in the Bring It Home feature, wants to know the going price of
wheat, they have to check on the computer or listen to the radio. Supply
and demand in the entire market solely determine the market price, not
the individual farmer. A perfectly competitive firm must be a very small
player in the overall market, so that it can increase or decrease output
without noticeably affecting the overall quantity supplied and price in
the market.

A perfectly competitive market is a hypothetical extreme; however,
producers in a number of industries do face many competitor firms
selling highly similar goods, in which case they must often act as price
takers. Economists often use agricultural markets as an example. The
same crops that different farmers grow are largely interchangeable.
According to the United States Department of Agriculture monthly
reports, in December 2021, U.S. corn farmers received an average of
\$5.47 per bushel. A corn farmer who attempted to sell at \$6.00 per
bushel would not have found any buyers. A perfectly competitive firm
will not sell below the equilibrium price either. Why should they when
they can sell all they want at the higher price? Other examples of
agricultural markets that operate in close to perfectly competitive
markets are small roadside produce markets and small organic farmers.

This chapter examines how profit-seeking firms decide how much to
produce in perfectly competitive markets. Such firms will analyze their
costs as we discussed in the chapter on [Production, Costs and Industry
Structure](http://openstax.org/books/principles-microeconomics-3e/pages/7-introduction-to-production-costs-and-industry-structure).
In the short run, the perfectly competitive firm will seek the quantity
of output where profits are highest or, if profits are not possible,
where losses are lowest.

In the long run, positive economic profits will attract competition as
other firms enter the market. Economic losses will cause firms to exit
the market. Ultimately, perfectly competitive markets will attain
long-run *equilibrium* when no new firms want to enter the market and
existing firms do not want to leave the market, as economic profits have
been driven down to zero.


### 8.2 How Perfectly Competitive Firms Make Output Decisions

#### Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

-   Calculate profits by comparing total revenue and total cost
-   Identify profits and losses with the average cost curve
-   Explain the shutdown point
-   Determine the price at which a firm should continue producing in the
    short run

A perfectly competitive firm has only one major decision to
make---namely, what quantity to produce. To understand this, consider a
different way of writing out the basic definition of profit:

![multiline equation line 1 Profit equals Total revenue minus Total cost
line 2 equals left parenthesis Price right parenthesis times left
parenthesis Quantity produced right parenthesis minus left parenthesis
Average cost right parenthesis times left parenthesis Quantity produced
right parenthesis](media/rId24.png){width="5.15625in"
height="0.3958333333333333in"}

Since a perfectly competitive firm must accept the price for its output
as determined by the product's market demand and supply, it cannot
choose the price it charges. This is already determined in the profit
equation, and so the perfectly competitive firm can sell any number of
units at exactly the same price. It implies that the firm faces a
perfectly elastic demand curve for its product: buyers are willing to
buy any number of units of output from the firm at the market price.
When the perfectly competitive firm chooses what quantity to produce,
then this quantity---along with the prices prevailing in the market for
output and inputs---will determine the firm's total revenue, total
costs, and ultimately, level of profits.

#### Determining the Highest Profit by Comparing Total Revenue and Total Cost

A perfectly competitive firm can sell as large a quantity as it wishes,
as long as it accepts the prevailing market price. The formula above
shows that total revenue depends on the quantity sold and the price
charged. If the firm sells a higher quantity of output, then total
revenue will increase. If the market price of the product increases,
then total revenue also increases whatever the quantity of output sold.
As an example of how a perfectly competitive firm decides what quantity
to produce, consider the case of a small farmer who produces raspberries
and sells them frozen for \$4 per pack. Sales of one pack of raspberries
will bring in \$4, two packs will be \$8, three packs will be \$12, and
so on. If, for example, the price of frozen raspberries doubles to \$8
per pack, then sales of one pack of raspberries will be \$8, two packs
will be \$16, three packs will be \$24, and so on.

[Table 8.1](#ch08mod02_tab01) shows total revenue and total costs for
the raspberry farm; these data also appear in [Figure
8.2](#CNX_Econ_C08_001). The horizontal axis shows the quantity of
frozen raspberries produced in packs. The vertical axis shows both total
revenue and total costs, measured in dollars. The total cost curve
intersects with the vertical axis at a value that shows the level of
fixed costs, and then slopes upward. All these cost curves follow the
same characteristics as the curves that we covered in the [Production,
Costs and Industry
Structure](http://openstax.org/books/principles-microeconomics-3e/pages/7-introduction-to-production-costs-and-industry-structure)
chapter.

Figure 8.2 Total Cost and Total Revenue at the Raspberry Farm Total
revenue for a perfectly competitive firm is a straight line sloping up.
The slope is equal to the price of the good. Total cost also slopes up,
but with some curvature. At higher levels of output, total cost begins
to slope upward more steeply because of diminishing marginal returns.
The maximum profit will occur at the quantity where the difference
between total revenue and total cost is largest.

Table 8.1 Total Cost and Total Revenue at the Raspberry Farm

Based on its total revenue and total cost curves, a perfectly
competitive firm like the raspberry farm can calculate the quantity of
output that will provide the highest level of profit. At any given
quantity, total revenue minus total cost will equal profit. One way to
determine the most profitable quantity to produce is to see at what
quantity total revenue exceeds total cost by the largest amount. [Figure
8.2](#CNX_Econ_C08_001) shows total revenue, total cost and profit using
the data from [Table 8.1](#ch08mod02_tab01). The vertical gap between
total revenue and total cost is profit, for example, at Q = 60, TR = 240
and TC = 165. The difference is 75, which is the height of the profit
curve at that output level. The firm doesn't make a profit at every
level of output. In this example, total costs will exceed total revenues
at output levels from 0 to approximately 30, and so over this range of
output, the firm will be making losses. At output levels from 40 to 100,
total revenues exceed total costs, so the firm is earning profits.
However, at any output greater than 100, total costs again exceed total
revenues and the firm is making increasing losses. Total profits appear
in the final column of [Table 8.1](#ch08mod02_tab01). Maximum profit
occurs at an output between 70 and 80, when profit equals \$90.

A higher price would mean that total revenue would be higher for every
quantity sold. A lower price would mean that total revenue would be
lower for every quantity sold. What happens if the price drops low
enough so that the total revenue line is completely below the total cost
curve; that is, at every level of output, total costs are higher than
total revenues? In this instance, the best the firm can do is to suffer
losses. However, a profit-maximizing firm will prefer the quantity of
output where total revenues come closest to total costs and thus where
the losses are smallest.

(Later we will see that sometimes it will make sense for the firm to
close, rather than stay in operation producing output.)

#### Comparing Marginal Revenue and Marginal Costs

The approach that we described in the previous section, using total
revenue and total cost, is not the only approach to determining the
profit maximizing level of output. In this section, we provide an
alternative approach which uses marginal revenue and marginal cost.

Firms often do not have the necessary data they need to draw a complete
total cost curve for all levels of production. They cannot be sure of
what total costs would look like if they, say, doubled production or cut
production in half, because they have not tried it. Instead, firms
experiment. They produce a slightly greater or lower quantity and
observe how it affects profits. In economic terms, this practical
approach to maximizing profits means examining how changes in production
affect marginal revenue and marginal cost.

[Figure 8.3](#CNX_Econ_C08_002) presents the marginal revenue and
marginal cost curves based on the total revenue and total cost in [Table
8.1](#ch08mod02_tab01). The marginal revenue curve shows the additional
revenue gained from selling one more unit. As mentioned before, a firm
in perfect competition faces a perfectly elastic demand curve for its
product---that is, the firm's demand curve is a horizontal line drawn at
the market price level. This also means that the firm's marginal revenue
curve is the same as the firm's demand curve: Every time a consumer
demands one more unit, the firm sells one more unit and revenue
increases by exactly the same amount equal to the market price. In this
example, every time the firm sells a pack of frozen raspberries, the
firm's revenue increases by \$4. [Table 8.2](#ch08mod02_tab02) shows an
example of this. This condition only holds for price taking firms in
perfect competition where:

$\text{marginal~revenue~=~price}$

The formula for marginal revenue is:

$\text{marginal~revenue~=~}\frac{\text{change~in~total~revenue}}{\text{change~in~quantity}}$

Table 8.2

Notice that marginal revenue does not change as the firm produces more
output. That is because under perfect competition, the price is
determined through the interaction of supply and demand in the market
and does not change as the farmer produces more (keeping in mind that,
due to the relative small size of each firm, increasing their supply has
no impact on the total market supply where price is determined).

Since a perfectly competitive firm is a price taker, it can sell
whatever quantity it wishes at the market-determined price. We calculate
marginal cost, the cost per additional unit sold, by dividing the change
in total cost by the change in quantity. The formula for marginal cost
is:

$\text{marginal~cost~=~}\frac{\text{change~in~total~cost}}{\text{change~in~quantity}}$

Ordinarily, marginal cost changes as the firm produces a greater
quantity.

In the raspberry farm example, in [Figure 8.3](#CNX_Econ_C08_002) and
[Table 8.3](#ch08mod02_tab03), marginal cost at first declines as
production increases from 10 to 20 to 30 to 40 packs of
raspberries---which represents the area of increasing marginal returns
that is not uncommon at low levels of production. At some point, though,
marginal costs start to increase, displaying the typical pattern of
diminishing marginal returns. If the firm is producing at a quantity
where MR \> MC, like 40 or 50 packs of raspberries, then it can increase
profit by increasing output because the marginal revenue is exceeding
the marginal cost. If the firm is producing at a quantity where MC \>
MR, like 90 or 100 packs, then it can increase profit by reducing output
because the reductions in marginal cost will exceed the reductions in
marginal revenue. The firm's profit-maximizing choice of output will
occur where MR = MC (or at a choice close to that point).

![](media/8-2-how-perfectly-competitive-firms-make-output-decisions_rId38.jpeg){width="4.88in" height="2.605in"}

Figure 8.3 Marginal Revenues and Marginal Costs at the Raspberry Farm:
Individual Farmer For a perfectly competitive firm, the marginal revenue
(MR) curve is a horizontal line because it is equal to the price of the
good, which is determined by the market, as [Figure
8.4](#CNX_Econ_C08_015) illustrates. The marginal cost (MC) curve is
sometimes initially downward-sloping, if there is a region of increasing
marginal returns at low levels of output, but is eventually
upward-sloping at higher levels of output as diminishing marginal
returns kick in.

![](media/8-2-how-perfectly-competitive-firms-make-output-decisions_rId41.jpeg){width="4.88in" height="2.655in"}

Figure 8.4 Supply, Demand, and Equilibrium Price in the Market for
Raspberries The equilibrium price of raspberries is determined through
the interaction of market supply and market demand at \$4.00.

Table 8.3 Marginal Revenues and Marginal Costs at the Raspberry Farm

In this example, the marginal revenue and marginal cost curves cross at
a price of \$4 and a quantity of 80 produced. If the farmer started out
producing at a level of 60, and then experimented with increasing
production to 70, marginal revenues from the increase in production
would exceed marginal costs---and so profits would rise. The farmer has
an incentive to keep producing. At a level of output of 80, marginal
cost and marginal revenue are equal so profit doesn't change. If the
farmer then experimented further with increasing production from 80 to
90, he would find that marginal costs from the increase in production
are greater than marginal revenues, and so profits would decline.

The profit-maximizing choice for a perfectly competitive firm will occur
at the level of output where marginal revenue is equal to marginal
cost---that is, where MR = MC. This occurs at Q = 80 in the figure.

#### Work It Out {#work-it-out .Heading3Grey}

##### Does Profit Maximization Occur at a Range of Output or a Specific Level of Output?  {#does-profit-maximization-occur-at-a-range-of-output-or-a-specific-level-of-output .Heading4Grey}

[Table 8.1](#ch08mod02_tab01) shows that maximum profit occurs at any
output level between 70 and 80 units of output. But MR = MC occurs only
at 80 units of output. How can we explain this slight discrepancy? As
long as MR \> MC, a profit-seeking firm should keep expanding
production. Expanding production into the zone where MR \< MC reduces
economic profits. It's true that profit is the same at Q = 70 and Q =
80, but it's only when the firm goes beyond that Q that it will see that
profits fall. Thus, MR = MC is the signal to stop expanding, so that is
the level of output they should target.

Because the marginal revenue received by a perfectly competitive firm is
equal to the price P, we can also write the profit-maximizing rule for a
perfectly competitive firm as a recommendation to produce at the
quantity of output where P = MC.

#### Profits and Losses with the Average Cost Curve

Does maximizing profit (producing where MR = MC) imply an actual
economic profit? The answer depends on the relationship between price
and average total cost, which is the average profit or profit margin. If
the market price is higher than the firm\'s average cost of production
for that quantity produced, then the profit margin is positive and the
firm will earn profits. Conversely, if the market price is lower than
the average cost of production, the profit margin is negative and the
firm will suffer losses. You might think that, in this situation, the
firm may want to shut down immediately. Remember, however, that the firm
has already paid for fixed costs, such as equipment, so it may continue
to produce for a while and incur a loss. [Table 8.3](#ch08mod02_tab03)
continues the raspberry farm example. [Figure 8.5](#CNX_Econ_C08_014)
illustrates the three possible scenarios: (a) where price intersects
marginal cost at a level above the average cost curve, (b) where price
intersects marginal cost at a level equal to the average cost curve, and
(c) where price intersects marginal cost at a level below the average
cost curve.

![](media/8-2-how-perfectly-competitive-firms-make-output-decisions_rId49.jpeg){width="6.5in" height="5.935in"}

Figure 8.5 Price and Average Cost at the Raspberry Farm In (a), price
intersects marginal cost above the average cost curve. Since price is
greater than average cost, the firm is making a profit. In (b), price
intersects marginal cost at the minimum point of the average cost curve.
Since price is equal to average cost, the firm is breaking even. In (c),
price intersects marginal cost below the average cost curve. Since price
is less than average cost, the firm is making a loss.

First consider a situation where the price is equal to \$5 for a pack of
frozen raspberries. The rule for a profit-maximizing perfectly
competitive firm is to produce the level of output where Price= MR = MC,
so the raspberry farmer will produce a quantity of approximately 85,
which is labeled as E\' in [Figure 8.5](#CNX_Econ_C08_014) (a). Remember
that the area of a rectangle is equal to its base multiplied by its
height. The farm's total revenue at this price will be shown by the
rectangle from the origin over to a quantity of 85 packs (the base) up
to point E\' (the height), over to the price of \$5, and back to the
origin. The average cost of producing 80 packs is shown by point C or
about \$3.50. Total costs will be the quantity of 85 times the average
cost of \$3.50, which is shown by the area of the rectangle from the
origin to a quantity of 90, up to point C, over to the vertical axis and
down to the origin. The difference between total revenues and total
costs is profits. Thus, profits will be the blue shaded rectangle on
top.

We calculate this as:

![multiline equation row 1 profit equals total revenue minus total cost

Or, we can calculate it as:

times 85 row 3 Blank equals dollar sign

Now consider [Figure 8.5](#CNX_Econ_C08_014) (b), where the price has
fallen to \$2.75 for a pack of frozen raspberries. Again, the perfectly
competitive firm will choose the level of output where Price = MR = MC,
but in this case, the quantity produced will be 75. At this price and
output level, where the marginal cost curve is crossing the average cost
curve, the price the firm receives is exactly equal to its average cost
of production. We call this the break even point.

The farm's total revenue at this price will be shown by the large shaded
rectangle from the origin over to a quantity of 75 packs (the base) up
to point E (the height), over to the price of \$2.75, and back to the
origin. The height of the average cost curve at Q = 75, i.e. point E,
shows the average cost of producing this quantity. Total costs will be
the quantity of 75 times the average cost of \$2.75, which is shown by
the area of the rectangle from the origin to a quantity of 75, up to
point E, over to the vertical axis and down to the origin. It should be
clear that the rectangles for total revenue and total cost are the same.
Thus, the firm is making zero profit. The calculations are as follows:

![multiline equation row 1 profit equals total revenue en dash total

In [Figure 8.5](#CNX_Econ_C08_014) (c), the market price has fallen
still further to \$2.00 for a pack of frozen raspberries. At this price,
marginal revenue intersects marginal cost at a quantity of 65. The
farm's total revenue at this price will be shown by the large shaded
rectangle from the origin over to a quantity of 65 packs (the base) up
to point E" (the height), over to the price of \$2, and back to the
origin. The average cost of producing 65 packs is shown by Point C" or
shows the average cost of producing 50 packs is about \$2.73. Total
costs will be the quantity of 65 times the average cost of \$2.73, which
the area of the rectangle from the origin to a quantity of 50, up to
point C", over to the vertical axis and down to the origin shows. It
should be clear from examining the two rectangles that total revenue is
less than total cost. Thus, the firm is losing money and the loss (or
negative profit) will be the rose-shaded rectangle.

If the market price that perfectly competitive firm receives leads it to
produce at a quantity where the price is greater than average cost, the
firm will earn profits. If the price the firm receives causes it to
produce at a quantity where price equals average cost, which occurs at
the minimum point of the AC curve, then the firm earns zero profits.
Finally, if the price the firm receives leads it to produce at a
quantity where the price is less than average cost, the firm will earn
losses. [Table 8.4](#ch08mod02_tab04) summarizes this.

Table 8.4

#### Clear It Up {#clear-it-up .Heading3Grey}

##### Which intersection should a firm choose? {#which-intersection-should-a-firm-choose .Heading4Grey}

At a price of \$2, MR intersects MC at two points: Q = 20 and Q = 65. It
never makes sense for a firm to choose a level of output on the downward
sloping part of the MC curve, because the profit is lower (the loss is
bigger). Thus, the correct choice of output is Q = 65.

#### The Shutdown Point

The possibility that a firm may earn losses raises a question: Why can
the firm not avoid losses by shutting down and not producing at all? The
answer is that shutting down can reduce variable costs to zero, but in
the short run, the firm has already paid for fixed costs. As a result,
if the firm produces a quantity of zero, it would still make losses
because it would still need to pay for its fixed costs. Therefore when a
firm is experiencing losses, it must face a question: should it continue
producing or should it shut down?

As an example, consider the situation of the Yoga Center, which has
signed a contract to rent space that costs \$10,000 per month. If the
firm decides to operate, its marginal costs for hiring yoga teachers is
\$15,000 for the month. If the firm shuts down, it must still pay the
rent, but it would not need to hire labor. [Table 8.5](#ch08mod02_tab05)
shows three possible scenarios. In the first scenario, the Yoga Center
does not have any clients, and therefore does not make any revenues, in
which case it faces losses of \$10,000 equal to the fixed costs. In the
second scenario, the Yoga Center has clients that earn the center
revenues of \$10,000 for the month, but ultimately experiences losses of
\$15,000 due to having to hire yoga instructors to cover the classes. In
the third scenario, the Yoga Center earns revenues of \$20,000 for the
month, but experiences losses of \$5,000.

In all three cases, the Yoga Center loses money. In all three cases,
when the rental contract expires in the long run, assuming revenues do
not improve, the firm should exit this business. In the short run,
though, the decision varies depending on the level of losses and whether
the firm can cover its variable costs. In scenario 1, the center does
not have any revenues, so hiring yoga teachers would increase variable
costs and losses, so it should shut down and only incur its fixed costs.
In scenario 2, the center's losses are greater because it does not make
enough revenue to offset the increased variable costs, so it should shut
down immediately and only incur its fixed costs. If price is below the
minimum average variable cost, the firm must shut down. In contrast, in
scenario 3 the revenue that the center can earn is high enough that the
losses diminish when it remains open, so the center should remain open
in the short run.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Scenario 1**

  If the center shuts down now, revenues are zero but it will not incur
  any variable costs and would only need to pay fixed costs of \$10,000.

Table 8.5 Should the Yoga Center Shut Down Now or Later?

[Figure 8.6](#CNX_Econ_C08_012) illustrates the lesson that remaining
open requires the price to exceed the firm's average variable cost. When
the firm is operating below the break-even point, where price equals
average cost, it is operating at a loss so it faces two options:
continue to produce and lose money or shutdown. Which option is
preferable? The one that loses the least money is the best choice.

At a price of \$2.00 per pack, as Figure 8.6 (a) illustrates, if the
farm stays in operation it will produce at a level of 65 packs of
raspberries, and it will make losses of \$47.45 (as explained earlier).
The alternative would be to shut down and lose all the fixed costs of
\$62.00. Since losing \$47.45 is preferable to losing \$62.00, the
profit maximizing (or in this case the loss minimizing) choice is to
stay in operation. The key reason is because price is above average
variable cost. This means that at the current price the farm can pay all
its variable costs, and have some revenue left over to pay some of the
fixed costs. So the loss represents the part of the fixed costs the farm
can't pay, which is less than the entire fixed costs. However, if the
price declined to \$1.50 per pack, as [Figure 8.6](#CNX_Econ_C08_012)
(b) shows, and if the firm applied its rule of producing where P = MR =
MC, it would produce a quantity of 60. This price is below average
variable cost for this level of output. If the farmer cannot pay workers
(the variable costs), then it has to shut down. At this price and
output, total revenues would be \$90 (quantity of 60 times price of
\$1.50) and total cost would be \$165, for overall losses of \$75. If
the farm shuts down, it must pay only its fixed costs of \$62, so
shutting down is preferable to selling at a price of \$1.50 per pack.

Figure 8.6 The Shutdown Point for the Raspberry Farm In (a), the farm
produces at a level of 65. It is making losses of \$47.50, but price is
above average variable cost, so it continues to operate. In (b), total
revenues are \$90 and total cost is \$165, for overall losses of \$75.
If the farm shuts down, it must pay only its fixed costs of \$62.
Shutting down is preferable to selling at a price of \$1.50 per pack.

Looking at [Table 8.6](#ch08mod02_tab06), if the price falls below about
\$1.72, the minimum average variable cost, the firm must shut down.

Table 8.6 Cost of Production for the Raspberry Farm

The intersection of the average variable cost curve and the marginal
cost curve, which shows the price below which the firm would lack enough
revenue to cover its variable costs, is called the **shutdown point**.
If the perfectly competitive firm faces a market price above the
shutdown point, then the firm is at least covering its average variable
costs. At a price above the shutdown point, the firm is also making
enough revenue to cover at least a portion of fixed costs, so it should
limp ahead even if it is making losses in the short run, since at least
those losses will be smaller than if the firm shuts down immediately and
incurs a loss equal to total fixed costs. However, if the firm is
receiving a price below the price at the shutdown point, then the firm
is not even covering its variable costs. In this case, staying open is
making the firm's losses larger, and it should shut down immediately. To
summarize, if:

-   price \< minimum average variable cost, then firm shuts down
-   price \> minimum average variable cost, then firm stays in business

#### Short-Run Outcomes for Perfectly Competitive Firms

The average cost and average variable cost curves divide the marginal
cost curve into three segments, as [Figure 8.7](#CNX_Econ_C08_008)
shows. At the market price, which the perfectly competitive firm accepts
as given, the profit-maximizing firm chooses the output level where
price or marginal revenue, which are the same thing for a perfectly
competitive firm, is equal to marginal cost: P = MR = MC.

![](media/8-2-how-perfectly-competitive-firms-make-output-decisions_rId79.jpeg){width="4.88in" height="3.38in"}

Figure 8.7 Profit, Loss, Shutdown We can divide the marginal cost curve
into three zones, based on where it is crossed by the average cost and
average variable cost curves. We call the point where MC crosses AC the
break even point. If the firm is operating where the market price is at
a level higher than the break even point, then price will be greater
than average cost and the firm is earning profits. If the price is
exactly at the break even point, then the firm is making zero profits.
If price falls in the zone between the shutdown point and the break even
point, then the firm is making losses but will continue to operate in
the short run, since it is covering its variable costs, and more if
price is above the shutdown-point price. However, if price falls below
the price at the shutdown point, then the firm will shut down
immediately, since it is not even covering its variable costs.

First consider the upper zone, where prices are above the level where
marginal cost (MC) crosses average cost (AC) at the zero profit point.
At any price above that level, the firm will earn profits in the short
run. If the price falls exactly on the break even point where the MC and
AC curves cross, then the firm earns zero profits. If a price falls into
the zone between the break even point, where MC crosses AC, and the
shutdown point, where MC crosses AVC, the firm will be making losses in
the short run---but since the firm is more than covering its variable
costs, the losses are smaller than if the firm shut down immediately.
Finally, consider a price at or below the shutdown point where MC
crosses AVC. At any price like this one, the firm will shut down
immediately, because it cannot even cover its variable costs.

#### Marginal Cost and the Firm's Supply Curve

For a perfectly competitive firm, the marginal cost curve is identical
to the firm's supply curve starting from the minimum point on the
average variable cost curve. To understand why this perhaps surprising
insight holds true, first think about what the supply curve means. A
firm checks the market price and then looks at its supply curve to
decide what quantity to produce. Now, think about what it means to say
that a firm will maximize its profits by producing at the quantity where
P = MC. This rule means that the firm checks the market price, and then
looks at its marginal cost to determine the quantity to produce---and
makes sure that the price is greater than the minimum average variable
cost. In other words, the marginal cost curve above the minimum point on
the average variable cost curve becomes the firm's supply curve.

#### Link It Up {#link-it-up .Heading3Grey}

Watch this [video](http://openstax.org/l/foodprice) that addresses how
drought in the United States can impact food prices across the world.

As we discussed in the chapter on [Demand and
Supply](http://openstax.org/books/principles-microeconomics-3e/pages/3-introduction-to-demand-and-supply),
many of the reasons that supply curves shift relate to underlying
changes in costs. For example, a lower price of key inputs or new
technologies that reduce production costs cause supply to shift to the
right. In contrast, bad weather or added government regulations can add
to costs of certain goods in a way that causes supply to shift to the
left. We can also interpret these shifts in the firm's supply curve as
shifts of the marginal cost curve. A shift in costs of production that
increases marginal costs at all levels of output---and shifts MC upward
and to the left---will cause a perfectly competitive firm to produce
less at any given market price. Conversely, a shift in costs of
production that decreases marginal costs at all levels of output will
shift MC downward and to the right and as a result, a competitive firm
will choose to expand its level of output at any given price. The
following Work It Out feature will walk you through an example.

#### Work It Out {#work-it-out-1 .Heading3Grey}

##### At What Price Should the Firm Continue Producing in the Short Run? {#at-what-price-should-the-firm-continue-producing-in-the-short-run .Heading4Grey}

To determine the short-run economic condition of a firm in perfect
competition, follow the steps outlined below. Use the data in [Table
8.7](#ch08mod02_tab07).

Table 8.7

Step 1. Determine the cost structure for the firm. For a given total
fixed costs and variable costs, calculate total cost, average variable
cost, average total cost, and marginal cost. Follow the formulas given
in the [Production, Costs, and Industry
Structure](http://openstax.org/books/principles-microeconomics-3e/pages/7-introduction-to-production-costs-and-industry-structure)

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Table 8.8

Step 2. Determine the market price that the firm receives for its
product. Since the firm in perfect competition is a price taker, the
market price is constant. With the given price, calculate total revenue
as equal to price multiplied by quantity for all output levels produced.
In this example, the given price is \$28. You can see that in the second
column of [Table 8.9](#ch08mod02_tab09).

Table 8.9

Step 3. Calculate profits as total cost subtracted from total revenue,
as [Table 8.10](#ch08mod02_tab10) shows.

Table 8.10

Step 4. To find the profit-maximizing output level, look at the Marginal
Cost column (at every output level produced), as [Table
8.11](#ch08mod02_tab11) shows, and determine where it is equal to the
market price. The output level where price equals the marginal cost is
the output level that maximizes profits.

Table 8.11

Step 5. Once you have determined the profit-maximizing output level (in
this case, output quantity 5), you can look at the amount of profits
made (in this case, \$40).

Step 6. If the firm is making economic losses, the firm needs to
determine whether it produces the output level where price equals
marginal revenue and equals marginal cost or it shuts down and only
incurs its fixed costs.

Step 7. For the output level where marginal revenue is equal to marginal
cost, check if the market price is greater than the average variable
cost of producing that output level.

-   If P \> AVC but P \< ATC, then the firm continues to produce in the
    short-run, making economic losses.
-   If P \< AVC, then the firm stops producing and only incurs its fixed
    costs.

In this example, the price of \$28 is greater than the AVC (\$16.40) of
producing 5 units of output, so the firm continues producing.


### 8.3 Entry and Exit Decisions in the Long Run

#### Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

-   Explain how entry and exit lead to zero profits in the long run
-   Discuss the long-run adjustment process

It is impossible to precisely define the line between the short run and
the long run with a stopwatch, or even with a calendar. It varies
according to the specific business. Therefore, the distinction between
the short run and the long run is more technical: in the short run,
firms cannot change the usage of fixed inputs, while in the long run,
the firm can adjust all factors of production.

In a competitive market, profits are a red cape that incites businesses
to charge. If a business is making a profit in the short run, it has an
incentive to expand existing factories or to build new ones. New firms
may start production, as well. When new firms enter the industry in
response to increased industry profits it is called entry.

Losses are the black thundercloud that causes businesses to flee. If a
business is making losses in the short run, it will either keep limping
along or just shut down, depending on whether its revenues are covering
its variable costs. But in the long run, firms that are facing losses
will cease production altogether. The long-run process of reducing
production in response to a sustained pattern of losses is called exit.
The following Clear It Up feature discusses where some of these losses
might come from, and the reasons why some firms go out of business.

#### Clear It Up {#clear-it-up .Heading3Grey}

##### Why do firms cease to exist? {#why-do-firms-cease-to-exist .Heading4Grey}

Can we say anything about what causes a firm to exit an industry?
Profits are the measurement that determines whether a business stays
operating or not. Individuals start businesses with the purpose of
making profits. They invest their money, time, effort, and many other
resources to produce and sell something that they hope will give them
something in return. Unfortunately, not all businesses are successful,
and many new startups soon realize that their "business venture" must
eventually end.

In the model of perfectly competitive firms, those that consistently
cannot make money will "exit," which is a nice, bloodless word for a
more painful process. When a business fails, after all, workers lose
their jobs, investors lose their money, and owners and managers can lose
their dreams. Many businesses fail. The U.S. Small Business
Administration indicates that in 2011, 534,907 new firms \"entered,\"
and 575,691 firms failed.

Sometimes a business fails because of poor management or workers who are
not very productive, or because of tough domestic or foreign
competition. Businesses also fail from a variety of causes. For example,
conditions of demand and supply in the market may shift in an unexpected
way, so that the prices that a business charges for outputs fall or the
prices for inputs rise. With millions of businesses in the U.S. economy,
even a small fraction of them failing will affect many people---and
business failures can be very hard on the workers and managers directly
involved. However, from the standpoint of the overall economic system,
business exits are sometimes a necessary evil if a market-oriented
system is going to offer a flexible mechanism for satisfying customers,
keeping costs low, and inventing new products.

#### How Entry and Exit Lead to Zero Profits in the Long Run

No perfectly competitive firm acting alone can affect the market price.
However, the combination of many firms entering or exiting the market
will affect overall supply in the market. In turn, a shift in supply for
the market as a whole will affect the market price. Entry and exit to
and from the market are the driving forces behind a process that, in the
long run, pushes the price down to minimum average total costs so that
all firms are earning a zero profit.

To understand how short-run profits for a perfectly competitive firm
will evaporate in the long run, imagine the following situation. The
market is in long-run equilibrium, where all firms earn zero economic
profits producing the output level where P = MR = MC and P = AC. No firm
has the incentive to enter or leave the market. Let's say that the
product's demand increases, and with that, the market price goes up. The
existing firms in the industry are now facing a higher price than
before, so they will increase production to the new output level where P
= MR = MC.

This will temporarily make the market price rise above the minimum point
on the average cost curve, and therefore, the existing firms in the
market will now be earning economic profits. However, these economic
profits attract other firms to enter the market. Entry of many new firms
causes the market supply curve to shift to the right. As the supply
curve shifts to the right, the market price starts decreasing, and with
that, economic profits fall for new and existing firms. As long as there
are still profits in the market, entry will continue to shift supply to
the right. This will stop whenever the market price is driven down to
the zero-profit level, where no firm is earning economic profits.

Short-run losses will fade away by reversing this process. Say that the
market is in long-run equilibrium. This time, instead, demand decreases,
and with that, the market price starts falling. The existing firms in
the industry are now facing a lower price than before, and as it will be
below the average cost curve, they will now be making economic losses.
Some firms will continue producing where the new P = MR = MC, as long as
they are able to cover their average variable costs. Some firms will
have to shut down immediately as they will not be able to cover their
average variable costs, and will then only incur their fixed costs,
minimizing their losses. Exit of many firms causes the market supply
curve to shift to the left. As the supply curve shifts to the left, the
market price starts rising, and economic losses start to be lower. This
process ends whenever the market price rises to the zero-profit level,
where the existing firms are no longer losing money and are at zero
profits again. Thus, while a perfectly competitive firm can earn profits
in the short run, in the long run the process of entry will push down
prices until they reach the zero-profit level. Conversely, while a
perfectly competitive firm may earn losses in the short run, firms will
not continually lose money. In the long run, firms making losses are
able to escape from their fixed costs, and their exit from the market
will push the price back up to the zero-profit level. In the long run,
this process of entry and exit will drive the price in perfectly
competitive markets to the zero-profit point at the bottom of the AC
curve, where marginal cost crosses average cost.

#### The Long-Run Adjustment and Industry Types

Whenever there are expansions in an industry, costs of production for
the existing and new firms could either stay the same, increase, or even
decrease. Therefore, we can categorize an industry as being (1) a
constant-cost industry (as demand increases, the cost of production for
firms stays the same), (2) an increasing cost industry (as demand
increases, the cost of production for firms increases), or (3) a
decreasing cost industry (as demand increases the costs of production
for the firms decreases).

For a constant-cost industry, whenever there is an increase in market
demand and price, then the supply curve shifts to the right with new
firms' entry and stops at the point where the new long-run equilibrium
intersects at the same market price as before. This is the case of
constant returns to scale, which we discussed earlier in the chapter on
Production, Costs, and Industry Structure. However, why will costs
remain the same? In this type of industry, the supply curve is very
elastic. Firms can easily supply any quantity that consumers demand. In
addition, there is a perfectly elastic supply of inputs---firms can
easily increase their demand for employees, for example, with no
increase to wages. Tying in to our Bring it Home discussion, an
increased demand for ethanol in recent years has caused the demand for
corn to increase. Consequently, many farmers switched from growing wheat
to growing corn. Agricultural markets are generally good examples of
constant-cost industries.

For an increasing cost industry, as the market expands, the old and new
firms experience increases in their costs of production, which makes the
new zero-profit level intersect at a higher price than before. Here
companies may have to deal with limited inputs, such as skilled labor.
As the demand for these workers rises, wages rise and this increases the
cost of production for all firms. The industry supply curve in this type
of industry is more inelastic.

For a decreasing cost industry, as the market expands, the old and new
firms experience lower costs of production, which makes the new
zero-profit level intersect at a lower price than before. In this case,
the industry and all the firms in it are experiencing falling average
total costs. This can be due to an improvement in technology in the
entire industry or an increase in the education of employees. High-tech
industries may be a good example of a decreasing cost market.

[Figure 8.8](#CNX_Econ_C08_013) (a) presents the case of an adjustment
process in a constant-cost industry. Whenever there are output
expansions in this type of industry, the long-run outcome implies more
output produced at exactly the same original price. Note that supply was
able to increase to meet the increased demand. When we join the before
and after long-run equilibriums, the resulting line is the long run
supply (LRS) curve in perfectly competitive markets. In this case, it is
a flat curve. [Figure 8.8](#CNX_Econ_C08_013) (b) and [Figure
8.8](#CNX_Econ_C08_013) (c) present the cases for an increasing cost and
decreasing cost industry, respectively. For an increasing cost industry,
the LRS is upward sloping, while for a decreasing cost industry, the LRS
is downward sloping.

![](media/8-3-entry-and-exit-decisions-in-the-long-run_rId32.jpeg){width="6.5in" height="1.98in"}

Figure 8.8 Adjustment Process in a Constant-Cost Industry In (a), demand
increased and supply met it. Notice that the supply increase is equal to
the demand increase. The result is that the equilibrium price stays the
same as quantity sold increases. In (b), notice that sellers were not
able to increase supply as much as demand. Some inputs were scarce, or
wages were rising. The equilibrium price rises. In (c), sellers easily
increased supply in response to the demand increase. Here, new
technology or economies of scale caused the large increase in supply,
resulting in declining equilibrium price.


### 8.4 Efficiency in Perfectly Competitive Markets

#### Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

-   Apply concepts of productive efficiency and allocative efficiency to
    perfectly competitive markets
-   Compare the model of perfect competition to real-world markets

When profit-maximizing firms in perfectly competitive markets combine
with utility-maximizing consumers, something remarkable happens: the
resulting quantities of outputs of goods and services demonstrate both
productive and allocative efficiency (terms that we first introduced in
([Choice in a World of
Scarcity](http://openstax.org/books/principles-microeconomics-3e/pages/2-introduction-to-choice-in-a-world-of-scarcity))
.

Productive efficiency means producing without waste, so that the choice
is on the production possibility frontier. In the long run in a
perfectly competitive market, because of the process of entry and exit,
the price in the market is equal to the minimum of the long-run average
cost curve. In other words, firms produce and sell goods at the lowest
possible average cost.

Allocative efficiency means that among the points on the production
possibility frontier, the chosen point is socially preferred---at least
in a particular and specific sense. In a perfectly competitive market,
price will be equal to the marginal cost of production. Think about the
price that one pays for a good as a measure of the social benefit one
receives for that good; after all, willingness to pay conveys what the
good is worth to a buyer. Then think about the marginal cost of
producing the good as representing not just the cost for the firm, but
more broadly as the social cost of producing that good. When perfectly
competitive firms follow the rule that profits are maximized by
producing at the quantity where price is equal to marginal cost, they
are thus ensuring that the social benefits they receive from producing a
good are in line with the social costs of production.

To explore what economists mean by allocative efficiency, it is useful
to walk through an example. Begin by assuming that the market for
wholesale flowers is perfectly competitive, and so P = MC. Now, consider
what it would mean if firms in that market produced a lesser quantity of
flowers. At a lesser quantity, marginal costs will not yet have
increased as much, so that price will exceed marginal cost; that is, P
\> MC. In that situation, the benefit to society as a whole of producing
additional goods, as measured by the willingness of consumers to pay for
marginal units of a good, would be higher than the cost of the inputs of
labor and physical capital needed to produce the marginal good. In other
words, the gains to society as a whole from producing additional
marginal units will be greater than the costs.

Conversely, consider what it would mean if, compared to the level of
output at the allocatively efficient choice when P = MC, firms produced
a greater quantity of flowers. At a greater quantity, marginal costs of
production will have increased so that P \< MC. In that case, the
marginal costs of producing additional flowers is greater than the
benefit to society as measured by what people are willing to pay. For
society as a whole, since the costs are outstripping the benefits, it
will make sense to produce a lower quantity of such goods.

When perfectly competitive firms maximize their profits by producing the
quantity where P = MC, they also assure that the benefits to consumers
of what they are buying, as measured by the price they are willing to
pay, is equal to the costs to society of producing the marginal units,
as measured by the marginal costs the firm must pay---and thus that
allocative efficiency holds.

We should view the statements that a perfectly competitive market in the
long run will feature both productive and allocative efficiency with a
degree of skepticism about its truth. Remember, economists are using the
concept of "efficiency" in a particular and specific sense, not as a
synonym for "desirable in every way." For one thing, consumers' ability
to pay reflects the income distribution in a particular society. For
example, a person with a low income may not be able to purchase their
own car because they have insufficient income.

Perfect competition, in the long run, is a hypothetical benchmark. For
market structures such as monopoly, monopolistic competition, and
oligopoly, which are more frequently observed in the real world than
perfect competition, firms will not always produce at the minimum of
average cost, nor will they always set price equal to marginal cost.
Thus, these other competitive situations will not produce productive and
allocative efficiency.

Moreover, real-world markets include many issues that are assumed away
in the model of perfect competition, including pollution, inventions of
new technology, poverty which may make some people unable to pay for
basic necessities of life, government programs like national defense or
education, discrimination in labor markets, and buyers and sellers who
must deal with imperfect and unclear information. We explore these
issues in other chapters. However, the theoretical efficiency of perfect
competition does provide a useful benchmark for comparing the issues
that arise from these real-world problems.

A quick glance at [Table 8.12](#ch08mod04_tab01) reveals the dramatic
increase in North Dakota corn production---almost a tenfold increase
since 1972. Recent allocation of land to corn (as of mid-2019) is
estimated to have increased to more than 4 million acres. Taking into
consideration that corn typically yields two to three times as many
bushels per acre as wheat, it is obvious there has been a significant
increase in bushels of corn. Why the increase in corn acreage?
Converging prices.

Table 8.12 (Source: USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service)

Historically, wheat prices have been higher than corn prices, offsetting
wheat's lower yield per acre. However, in recent years wheat and corn
prices have been converging. In April 2013, *Agweek* reported the gap
was just 71 cents per bushel. As the difference in price narrowed,
switching to the production of higher yield per acre of corn simply made
good business sense. Erik Younggren, president of the National
Association of Wheat Growers said in the *Agweek* article, "I don\'t
think we\'re going to see mile after mile of waving amber fields \[of
wheat\] anymore.\" (Until wheat prices rise, we will probably be seeing
field after field of tasseled corn.)

### Introduction to Perfect Competition

##### A Dime a Dozen {#a-dime-a-dozen .Heading4Grey}

When you were younger did you babysit, deliver papers, or mow the lawn
for money? If so, you faced stiff competition from many other
competitors who offered identical services. There was nothing to stop
others from also offering their services.

All of you charged the "going rate." If you tried to charge more, your
customers would simply buy from someone else. These conditions are very
similar to the conditions agricultural growers face.

Growing a crop may be more difficult to start than a babysitting or lawn
mowing service, but growers face the same fierce competition. In the
grand scale of world agriculture, farmers face competition from
thousands of others because they sell an identical product. After all,
winter wheat is winter wheat, but if they find it hard to make money
with that crop, it is relatively easy for farmers to leave the
marketplace for another crop. In this case, they do not sell the family
farm, they switch crops.

Take the case of the upper Midwest region of the United States---for
many generations the area was called "King Wheat." According to the
United States Department of Agriculture National Agricultural Statistics
Service, statistics by state, in 1997, 11.6 million acres of wheat and
780,000 acres of corn were planted in North Dakota. In the intervening
25 or so years has the mix of crops changed? Since it is relatively easy
to switch crops, did farmers change what they planted in response to
changes in relative crop prices? We will find out at chapter's end.

In the meantime, let\'s consider the topic of this chapter---the
perfectly competitive market. This is a market in which entry and exit
are relatively easy and competitors are "a dime a dozen."

Most businesses face two realities: no one is required to buy their
products, and even customers who might want those products may buy from
other businesses instead. Firms that operate in perfectly competitive
markets face this reality. In this chapter, you will learn how such
firms make decisions about how much to produce, how much profit they
make, whether to stay in business or not, and many others. Industries
differ from one another in terms of how many sellers there are in a
specific market, how easy or difficult it is for a new firm to enter,
and the type of products that they sell. Economists refer to this as an
industry\'s market structure. In this chapter, we focus on perfect
competition. However, in other chapters we will examine other industry
types:
[Monopoly](http://openstax.org/books/principles-microeconomics-3e/pages/9-introduction-to-a-monopoly)
and [Monopolistic Competition and
Oligopoly](http://openstax.org/books/principles-microeconomics-3e/pages/10-introduction-to-monopolistic-competition-and-oligopoly).
