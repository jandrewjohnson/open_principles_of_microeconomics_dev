-   Interpret a graph of regulatory choices
-   Contrast cost-plus and price cap regulation

Most true monopolies today in the U.S. are regulated, natural
monopolies. A natural monopoly poses a difficult challenge for
competition policy, because the structure of costs and demand makes
competition unlikely or costly. A natural monopoly arises when average
costs are declining over the range of production that satisfies market
demand. This typically happens when fixed costs are large relative to
variable costs. As a result, one firm is able to supply the total
quantity demanded in the market at lower cost than two or more
firms---so splitting up the natural monopoly would raise the average
cost of production and force customers to pay more.

Public utilities, the companies that have traditionally provided water
and electrical service across much of the United States, are leading
examples of natural monopoly. It would make little sense to argue that a
local water company should be divided into several competing companies,
each with its own separate set of pipes and water supplies. Installing
four or five identical sets of pipes under a city, one for each water
company, so that each household could choose its own water provider,
would be terribly costly. The same argument applies to the idea of
having many competing companies for delivering electricity to homes,
each with its own set of wires. Before the advent of wireless phones,
the argument also applied to the idea of many different phone companies,
each with its own set of phone wires running through the neighborhood.

### The Choices in Regulating a Natural Monopoly

What then is the appropriate competition policy for a natural monopoly?
[Figure 11.3](#CNX_Econ_C11_003) illustrates the case of natural
monopoly, with a market demand curve that cuts through the
downward-sloping portion of the average cost curve. Points A, B, C, and
F illustrate four of the main choices for regulation. [Table
11.3](#Table_11_05) outlines the regulatory choices for dealing with a
natural monopoly.

Figure 11.3 Regulatory Choices in Dealing with Natural Monopoly A
natural monopoly will maximize profits by producing at the quantity
where marginal revenue (MR) equals marginal costs (MC) and by then
looking to the market demand curve to see what price to charge for this
quantity. This monopoly will produce at point A, with a quantity of 4
and a price of 9.3. If antitrust regulators split this company exactly
in half, then each half would produce at point B, with average costs of
9.75 and output of 2. The regulators might require the firm to produce
where marginal cost crosses the market demand curve at point C. However,
if the firm is required to produce at a quantity of 8 and sell at a
price of 3.5, the firm will incur losses. The most likely choice is
point F, where the firm is required to produce a quantity of 6 and
charge a price of 6.5.

Table 11.3 Regulatory Choices in Dealing with Natural Monopoly (\*We
obtain total revenue by multiplying price and quantity. However, we have
rounded some of the price values in this table for ease of
presentation.)

The first possibility is to leave the natural monopoly alone. In this
case, the monopoly will follow its normal approach to maximizing
profits. It determines the quantity where MR = MC, which happens at
point P at a quantity of 4. The firm then looks to point A on the demand
curve to find that it can charge a price of 9.3 for that
profit-maximizing quantity. Since the price is above the average cost
curve, the natural monopoly would earn economic profits.

A second outcome arises if antitrust authorities decide to divide the
company, so that the new firms can compete. As a simple example, imagine
that the company is cut in half. Thus, instead of one large firm
producing a quantity of 4, two half-size firms each produce a quantity
of 2. Because of the declining average cost curve (AC), the average cost
of production for each of the half-size companies producing 2, as point
B shows, would be 9.75, while the average cost of production for a
larger firm producing 4 would only be 7.75. Thus, the economy would
become less productively efficient, since the good is produced at a
higher average cost. In a situation with a downward-sloping average cost
curve, two smaller firms will always have higher average costs of
production than one larger firm for any quantity of total output. In
addition, the antitrust authorities must worry that splitting the
natural monopoly into pieces may be only the start of their problems. If
one of the two firms grows larger than the other, it will have lower
average costs and may be able to drive its competitor out of the market.
Alternatively, two firms in a market may discover subtle ways of
coordinating their behavior and keeping prices high. Either way, the
result will not be the greater competition that was desired.

A third alternative is that regulators may decide to set prices and
quantities produced for this industry. The regulators will try to choose
a point along the market demand curve that benefits both consumers and
the broader social interest. Point C illustrates one tempting choice:
the regulator requires that the firm produce the quantity of output
where marginal cost crosses the demand curve at an output of 8, and
charge the price of 3.5, which is equal to marginal cost at that point.
This rule is appealing because it requires price to be set equal to
marginal cost, which is what would occur in a perfectly competitive
market, and it would assure consumers a higher quantity and lower price
than at the monopoly choice A. In fact, efficient allocation of
resources would occur at point C, since the value to the consumers of
the last unit bought and sold in this market is equal to the marginal
cost of producing it.

Attempting to bring about point C through force of regulation, however,
runs into a severe difficulty. At point C, with an output of 8, a price
of 3.5 is below the average cost of production, which is 5.7, so if the
firm charges a price of 3.5, it will be suffering losses. Unless the
regulators or the government offer the firm an ongoing public subsidy
(and there are numerous political problems with that option), the firm
will lose money and go out of business.

Perhaps the most plausible option for the regulator is point F; that is,
to set the price where AC crosses the demand curve at an output of 6 and
a price of 6.5. This plan makes some sense at an intuitive level: let
the natural monopoly charge enough to cover its average costs and earn a
normal rate of profit, so that it can continue operating, but prevent
the firm from raising prices and earning abnormally high monopoly
profits, as it would at the monopoly choice A. Determining this level of
output and price with the political pressures, time constraints, and
limited information of the real world is much harder than identifying
the point on a graph. For more on the problems that can arise from a
centrally determined price, see the discussion of price floors and price
ceilings in [Demand and
Supply](http://openstax.org/books/principles-microeconomics-3e/pages/3-introduction-to-demand-and-supply).

### Cost-Plus versus Price Cap Regulation

Regulators of public utilities for many decades followed the general
approach of attempting to choose a point like F in [Figure
11.3](#CNX_Econ_C11_003). They calculated the average cost of production
for the water or electricity companies, added in an amount for the
normal rate of profit the firm should expect to earn, and set the price
for consumers accordingly. This method was known as cost-plus
regulation.

Cost-plus regulation raises difficulties of its own. If producers
receive reimbursement for their costs, plus a bit more, then at a
minimum, producers have less reason to be concerned with high
costs---because they can just pass them along in higher prices. Worse,
firms under cost-plus regulation even have an incentive to generate high
costs by building huge factories or employing many staff, because what
they can charge is linked to the costs they incur.

Thus, in the 1980s and 1990s, some public utility regulators began to
use price cap regulation, where the regulator sets a price that the firm
can charge over the next few years. A common pattern was to require a
price that declined slightly over time. If the firm can find ways of
reducing its costs more quickly than the price caps, it can make a high
level of profits. However, if the firm cannot keep up with the price
caps or suffers bad luck in the market, it may suffer losses. A few
years down the road, the regulators will then set a new series of price
caps based on the firm's performance.

Price cap regulation requires delicacy. It will not work if the price
regulators set the price cap unrealistically low. It may not work if the
market changes dramatically so that the firm is doomed to incurring
losses no matter what it does---say, if energy prices rise dramatically
on world markets, then the company selling natural gas or heating oil to
homes may not be able to meet price caps that seemed reasonable a year
or two ago. However, if the regulators compare the prices with producers
of the same good in other areas, they can, in effect, pressure a natural
monopoly in one area to compete with the prices charged in other areas.
Moreover, the possibility of earning greater profits or experiencing
losses---instead of having an average rate of profit locked in every
year by cost-plus regulation---can provide the natural monopoly with
incentives for efficiency and innovation.

With natural monopoly, market competition is unlikely to take root, so
if consumers are not to suffer the high prices and restricted output of
an unrestricted monopoly, government regulation will need to play a
role. In attempting to design a system of price cap regulation with
flexibility and incentive, government regulators do not have an easy
task.
