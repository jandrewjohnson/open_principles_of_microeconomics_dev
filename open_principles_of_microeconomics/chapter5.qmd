### Introduction to Elasticity

#### Bring It Home {#bring-it-home .Heading3Grey}

##### That Will Be How Much? {#that-will-be-how-much .Heading4Grey}

Imagine going to your favorite coffee shop and having the waiter inform
you the pricing has changed. Instead of \$3 for a cup of coffee, you
will now be charged \$2 for coffee, \$1 for creamer, and \$1 for your
choice of sweetener. If you pay your usual \$3 for a cup of coffee, you
must choose between creamer and sweetener. If you want both, you now
face an extra charge of \$1. Sound absurd? Well, that is similar to the
situation Netflix customers found themselves in---they faced a 60% price
hike to retain the same service in 2011.

In early 2011, Netflix consumers paid about \$10 a month for a package
consisting of streaming video and DVD rentals. In July 2011, the company
announced a packaging change. Customers wishing to retain both streaming
video and DVD rental would be charged \$15.98 per month, a price
increase of about 60%. In 2014, Netflix also raised its streaming video
subscription price from \$7.99 to \$8.99 per month for new U.S.
customers. The company also changed its policy of 4K streaming content
from \$9.00 to \$12.00 per month that year.

How would customers of the 18-year-old firm react? Would they abandon
Netflix? Would the ease of access to other venues make a difference in
how consumers responded to the Netflix price change? At the time,
Netflix had few competitors; in the intervening years, the field has
grown to ten major competitors and nearly 200 smaller ones. Is that
likely to have a greater impact than the price changes? We will explore
the answers to those questions in this chapter, which focuses on the
change in quantity with respect to a change in price, a concept
economists call elasticity.

Anyone who has studied economics knows the law of demand: a higher price
will lead to a lower quantity demanded. What you may not know is how
much lower the quantity demanded will be. Similarly, the law of supply
states that a higher price will lead to a higher quantity supplied. The
question is: How much higher? This chapter will explain how to answer
these questions and why they are critically important in the real world.

To find answers to these questions, we need to understand the concept of
elasticity. Elasticity is an economics concept that measures
responsiveness of one variable to changes in another variable. Suppose
you drop two items from a second-floor balcony. The first item is a
tennis ball. The second item is a brick. Which will bounce higher?
Obviously, the tennis ball. We would say that the tennis ball has
greater elasticity.

Consider an economic example. Cigarette taxes are an example of a "sin
tax," a tax on something that is bad for you, like alcohol. Governments
tax cigarettes at the state and national levels. As of 2021, state taxes
ranged from a low of 17 cents per pack in Missouri to \$4.35 per pack in
Connecticut and New York. The average state cigarette tax is \$1.76 per
pack. The 2021 federal tax rate on cigarettes was \$1.01 per pack. In
2015, the Obama Administration proposed raising the federal tax nearly a
dollar to \$1.95 per pack. The key question is: How much would cigarette
purchases decline?

Taxes on cigarettes serve two purposes: to raise tax revenue for
government and to discourage cigarette consumption. However, if a higher
cigarette tax discourages consumption considerably, meaning a greatly
reduced quantity of cigarette sales, then the cigarette tax on each pack
will not raise much revenue for the government. Alternatively, a higher
cigarette tax that does not discourage consumption by much will actually
raise more tax revenue for the government. Thus, when a government
agency tries to calculate the effects of altering its cigarette tax, it
must analyze how much the tax affects the quantity of cigarettes
consumed. This issue reaches beyond governments and taxes. Every firm
faces a similar issue. When a firm considers raising the sales price, it
must consider how much a price increase will reduce the quantity
demanded of what it sells. Conversely, when a firm puts its products on
sale, it must expect (or hope) that the lower price will lead to a
significantly higher quantity demanded.


### 5.1 Price Elasticity of Demand and Price Elasticity of Supply

#### Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

-   Calculate the price elasticity of demand
-   Calculate the price elasticity of supply

Both the demand and supply curve show the relationship between price and
the number of units demanded or supplied. Price elasticity is the ratio
between the percentage change in the quantity demanded (Qd) or supplied
(Qs) and the corresponding percent change in price. The price elasticity
of demand is the percentage change in the quantity *demanded* of a good
or service divided by the percentage change in the price. The price
elasticity of supply is the percentage change in quantity *supplied*
divided by the percentage change in price.

We can usefully divide elasticities into three broad categories:
elastic, inelastic, and unitary. Because price and quantity demanded
move in opposite directions, price elasticity of demand is always a
negative number. Therefore, price elasticity of demand is usually
reported as its absolute value, without a negative sign. The summary in
@tbl-table_5_1 is assuming absolute values for price
elasticity of demand. An elastic demand or elastic supply is one in
which the elasticity is greater than one, indicating a high
responsiveness to changes in price. Elasticities that are less than one
indicate low responsiveness to price changes and correspond to inelastic
demand or inelastic supply. Unitary elasticities indicate proportional
responsiveness of either demand or supply, as @tbl-table_5_1
summarizes.

| "% change in quantity" < "% change in price"   | "% change in quantity" / "% change in price" < 1  | Inelastic              |

#### Link It Up {#link-it-up .Heading3Grey}

Before we delve into the details of elasticity, enjoy this
[article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/prishe/2013/09/19/super-bowl-xlviii-pricing-a-lesson-in-demand-elasticity/?sh=6ae6f1c2796f) on elasticity and ticket
prices at the Super Bowl.

To calculate elasticity along a demand or supply curve economists use
the average percent change in both quantity and price. This is called
the Midpoint Method for Elasticity, and is represented in the following
equations:

$$
\begin{array}{r}
\% \text { change in quantity }=\frac{\mathrm{Q}_2-\mathrm{Q}_1}{\left(\mathrm{Q}_2+\mathrm{Q}_1\right) / 2} \times 100 \\
\% \text { change in price }=\frac{\mathrm{P}_2-\mathrm{P}_1}{\left(\mathrm{P}_2+\mathrm{P}_1\right) / 2} \times 100
\end{array}
$$

The advantage of the Midpoint Method is that one obtains the same
elasticity between two price points whether there is a price increase or
decrease. This is because the formula uses the same base (average
quantity and average price) for both cases.

#### Calculating Price Elasticity of Demand

Let's calculate the elasticity between points A and B and between points
G and H as [Figure 5.2](#fig-5_2) shows.

![](media/5-1-price-elasticity-of-demand-and-price-elasticity-of-supply_rId35.jpeg){width="4.88in" height="3.215in" #fig-5_2}

Figure 5.2 Calculating the Price Elasticity of Demand We calculate the
price elasticity of demand as the percentage change in quantity divided
by the percentage change in price.

First, apply the formula to calculate the elasticity as price decreases
from \$70 at point B to \$60 at point A:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\% \text { change in quantity } & =\frac{3,000-2,800}{(3,000+2,800) / 2} \times 100 \\
& =\frac{200}{2,900} \times 100 \\
& =6.9 \\
\% \text { change in price } & =\frac{60-70}{(60+70) / 2} \times 100 \\
& =\frac{-10}{65} \times 100 \\
& =-15.4 \\
\text { Price Elasticity of Demand } & =\frac{6.9 \%}{-15.4 \%} \\
& =0.45
\end{aligned}
$$

Therefore, the elasticity of demand between these two points is
$\frac{\ \ \ \ 6.9\%}{â€“15.4\%}$ which is 0.45, an amount smaller than
one, showing that the demand is inelastic in this interval. Price
elasticities of demand are *always* negative since price and quantity
demanded always move in opposite directions (on the demand curve). By
convention, we always talk about elasticities as positive numbers.
Mathematically, we take the absolute value of the result. We will ignore
this detail from now on, while remembering to interpret elasticities as
positive numbers.

This means that, along the demand curve between point B and A, if the
price changes by 1%, the quantity demanded will change by 0.45%. A
change in the price will result in a smaller percentage change in the
quantity demanded. For example, a 10% *increase* in the price will
result in only a 4.5% *decrease* in quantity demanded. A 10% *decrease*
in the price will result in only a 4.5% *increase* in the quantity
demanded. Price elasticities of demand are negative numbers indicating
that the demand curve is downward sloping, but we read them as absolute
values. The following Work It Out feature will walk you through
calculating the price elasticity of demand.

#### Work It Out {#work-it-out .Heading3Grey}

##### Finding the Price Elasticity of Demand {#finding-the-price-elasticity-of-demand .Heading4Grey}

Calculate the price elasticity of demand using the data in [Figure
5.2](#fig-5_2) for an increase in price from G to H. Has the
elasticity increased or decreased?

Step 1. We know that:

$$
\text { Price Elasticity of Demand }=\frac{\% \text { change in quantity }}{\% \text { change in price }}
$$

Step 2. From the Midpoint Formula we know that:

$$
\begin{array}{r}
\% \text { change in quantity }=\frac{\mathrm{Q}_2-\mathrm{Q}_1}{\left(\mathrm{Q}_2+\mathrm{Q}_1\right) / 2} \times 100 \\
\% \text { change in price }=\frac{\mathrm{P}_2-\mathrm{P}_1}{\left(\mathrm{P}_2+\mathrm{P}_1\right) / 2} \times 100
\end{array}
$$

Step 3. So we can use the values provided in the figure in each
equation:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \% \text { change in quantity }=\frac{1,600-1,800}{(1,600+1,800) / 2} \times 100 \\
& =\frac{-200}{1,700} \times 100 \\
& =-11.76 \\
& \% \text { change in price }=\frac{130-120}{(130+120) / 2} \times 100 \\
& =\frac{10}{125} \times 100 \\
& =8.0 \\
&
\end{aligned}
$$

Step 4. Then, we can use those values to determine the price elasticity
of demand:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { Price Elasticity of Demand } & =\frac{\% \text { change in quantity }}{\% \text { change in price }} \\
& =\frac{-11.76}{8} \\
& =1.47
\end{aligned}
$$

Therefore, the elasticity of demand from G to is H 1.47. The magnitude
of the elasticity has increased (in absolute value) as we moved up along
the demand curve from points A to B. Recall that the elasticity between
these two points was 0.45. Demand was inelastic between points A and B
and elastic between points G and H. This shows us that price elasticity
of demand changes at different points along a straight-line demand
curve.

#### Calculating the Price Elasticity of Supply

Assume that an apartment rents for \$650 per month and at that price the
landlord rents 10,000 units as [Figure 5.3](#fig-5_3) shows.
When the price increases to \$700 per month, the landlord supplies
13,000 units into the market. By what percentage does apartment supply
increase? What is the price sensitivity?

![](media/5-1-price-elasticity-of-demand-and-price-elasticity-of-supply_rId54.jpeg){width="3.25in" height="2.635in" #fig-5_3}

Figure 5.3 Price Elasticity of Supply We calculate the price elasticity
of supply as the percentage change in quantity divided by the percentage
change in price.

Using the Midpoint Method,

$$
\begin{aligned}
\% \text { change in quantity } & =\frac{13,000-10,000}{(13,000+10,000) / 2} \times 100 \\
& =\frac{3,000}{11,500} \times 100 \\
& =26.1 \\
\% \text { change in price } & =\frac{\$ 700-\$ 650}{(\$ 700+\$ 650) / 2} \times 100 \\
& =\frac{50}{675} \times 100 \\
& =7.4 \\
\text { Price Elasticity of Supply } & =\frac{26.1 \%}{7.4 \%} \\
& =3.53
\end{aligned}
$$

Again, as with the elasticity of demand, the elasticity of supply is not
followed by any units. Elasticity is a ratio of one percentage change to
another percentage change---nothing more---and we read it as an absolute
value. In this case, a 1% rise in price causes an increase in quantity
supplied of 3.5%. The greater than one elasticity of supply means that
the percentage change in quantity supplied will be greater than a one
percent price change. If you\'re starting to wonder if the concept of
slope fits into this calculation, read the following Clear It Up box.

#### Clear It Up {#clear-it-up .Heading3Grey}

##### Is the elasticity the slope? {#is-the-elasticity-the-slope .Heading4Grey}

It is a common mistake to confuse the slope of either the supply or
demand curve with its elasticity. The slope is the rate of change in
units along the curve, or the rise/run (change in y over the change in
x). For example, in [Figure 5.2](#fig-5_2), at each point shown
on the demand curve, price drops by \$10 and the number of units
demanded increases by 200 compared to the point to its left. The slope
is --10/200 along the entire demand curve and does not change. The price
elasticity, however, changes along the curve. Elasticity between points
A and B was 0.45 and increased to 1.47 between points G and H.
Elasticity is the *percentage* change, which is a different calculation
from the slope and has a different meaning.

When we are at the upper end of a demand curve, where price is high and
the quantity demanded is low, a small change in the quantity demanded,
even in, say, one unit, is pretty big in percentage terms. A change in
price of, say, a dollar, is going to be much less important in
percentage terms than it would have been at the bottom of the demand
curve. Likewise, at the bottom of the demand curve, that one unit change
when the quantity demanded is high will be small as a percentage.

Thus, at one end of the demand curve, where we have a large percentage
change in quantity demanded over a small percentage change in price, the
elasticity value would be high, or demand would be relatively elastic.
Even with the same change in the price and the same change in the
quantity demanded, at the other end of the demand curve the quantity is
much higher, and the price is much lower, so the percentage change in
quantity demanded is smaller and the percentage change in price is much
higher. That means at the bottom of the curve we\'d have a small
numerator over a large denominator, so the elasticity measure would be
much lower, or inelastic.

As we move along the demand curve, the values for quantity and price go
up or down, depending on which way we are moving, so the percentages
for, say, a \$1 difference in price or a one unit difference in
quantity, will change as well, which means the ratios of those
percentages and hence the elasticity will change.


### 5.2 Polar Cases of Elasticity and Constant Elasticity

#### Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

-   Differentiate between infinite and zero elasticity
-   Analyze graphs in order to classify elasticity as constant unitary,
    infinite, or zero

There are two extreme cases of elasticity: when elasticity equals zero
and when it is infinite. A third case of interest is that of constant
unitary elasticity. We will describe each case. Infinite elasticity or
perfect elasticity refers to the extreme case where either the quantity
demanded (Qd) or supplied (Qs) changes by an infinite amount in response
to any change in price at all. In both cases, the supply and the demand
curve are horizontal as [Figure 5.4](#fig-5_4) shows. While
perfectly elastic supply curves are for the most part unrealistic, goods
with readily available inputs and whose production can easily expand
will feature highly elastic supply curves. Examples include pizza,
bread, books, and pencils. Similarly, perfectly elastic demand is an
extreme example. However, luxury goods, items that take a large share of
individuals' income, and goods with many substitutes are likely to have
highly elastic demand curves. Examples of such goods are Caribbean
cruises and sports vehicles.

![](media/5-2-polar-cases-of-elasticity-and-constant-elasticity_rId25.jpeg){width="4.88in" height="2.115in" #fig-5_4}

Figure 5.4 Infinite Elasticity The horizontal lines show that an
infinite quantity will be demanded or supplied at a specific price. This
illustrates the cases of a perfectly (or infinitely) elastic demand
curve and supply curve. The quantity supplied or demanded is extremely
responsive to price changes, moving from zero for prices close to P to
infinite when prices reach P.

Zero elasticity or perfect inelasticity, as [Figure
5.5](#fig-5_5) depicts, refers to the extreme case in which a
percentage change in price, no matter how large, results in zero change
in quantity. While a perfectly inelastic supply is an extreme example,
goods with limited supply of inputs are likely to feature highly
inelastic supply curves. Examples include diamond rings or housing in
prime locations such as apartments facing Central Park in New York City.
Similarly, while perfectly inelastic demand is an extreme case,
necessities with no close substitutes are likely to have highly
inelastic demand curves. This is the case of life-saving drugs and
gasoline.

![](media/5-2-polar-cases-of-elasticity-and-constant-elasticity_rId30.jpeg){width="4.88in" height="2.0999989063867015in" #fig-5_5}

Figure 5.5 Zero Elasticity The vertical supply curve and vertical demand
curve show that there will be zero percentage change in quantity (a)
demanded or (b) supplied, regardless of the price.

Constant unitary elasticity, in either a supply or demand curve, occurs
when a price change of one percent results in a quantity change of one
percent. [Figure 5.6](#fig-5_6) shows a demand curve with
constant unit elasticity. Using the midpoint method, you can calculate
that between points A and B on the demand curve, the price changes by
66.7% and quantity demanded also changes by 66.7%. Hence, the elasticity
equals 1. Between points B and C, price again changes by 66.7% as does
quantity, while between points C and D the corresponding percentage
changes are again 66.7% for both price and quantity. In each case, then,
the percentage change in price equals the percentage change in quantity,
and consequently elasticity equals 1. Notice that in absolute value, the
declines in price, as you step down the demand curve, are not identical.
Instead, the price falls by \$8.00 from A to B, by a smaller amount of
\$4.00 from B to C, and by a still smaller amount of \$2.00 from C to D.
As a result, a demand curve with constant unitary elasticity moves from
a steeper slope on the left and a flatter slope on the right---and a
curved shape overall.

![](media/5-2-polar-cases-of-elasticity-and-constant-elasticity_rId34.jpeg){width="4.875in" height="4.008333333333334in" #fig-5_6}

Figure 5.6 A Constant Unitary Elasticity Demand Curve A demand curve
with constant unitary elasticity will be a curved line. Notice how price
and quantity demanded change by an identical percentage amount between
each pair of points on the demand curve.

Unlike the demand curve with unitary elasticity, the supply curve with
unitary elasticity is represented by a straight line, and that line goes
through the origin. In each pair of points on the supply curve there is
an equal difference in quantity of 30. However, in percentage value,
using the midpoint method, the steps are decreasing as one moves from
left to right, from 28.6% to 22.2% to 18.2%, because the quantity points
in each percentage calculation are getting increasingly larger, which
expands the denominator in the elasticity calculation of the percentage
change in quantity.

Consider the price changes moving up the supply curve in [Figure
5.7](#fig-5_7). From points D to E to F and to G on the supply
curve, each step of \$1.50 is the same in absolute value. However, if we
measure the price changes in percentage change terms, using the midpoint
method, they are also decreasing, from 28.6% to 22.2% to 18.2%, because
the original price points in each percentage calculation are getting
increasingly larger in value, increasing the denominator in the
calculation of the percentage change in price. Along the constant
unitary elasticity supply curve, the percentage quantity increases on
the horizontal axis exactly match the percentage price increases on the
vertical axis---so this supply curve has a constant unitary elasticity
at all points.

Figure 5.7 A Constant Unitary Elasticity Supply Curve A constant unitary
elasticity supply curve is a straight line reaching up from the origin.
Between each pair of points, the percentage increase in quantity
supplied is the same as the percentage increase in price.


### 5.3 Elasticity and Pricing

#### Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

-   Analyze how price elasticities impact revenue
-   Evaluate how elasticity can cause shifts in demand and supply
-   Predict how the long-run and short-run impacts of elasticity affect
    equilibrium
-   Explain how the elasticity of demand and supply determine the
    incidence of a tax on buyers and sellers

Studying elasticities is useful for a number of reasons, pricing being
most important. Let's explore how elasticity relates to revenue and
pricing, both in the long and short run. First, let's look at the
elasticities of some common goods and services.

@tbl-table_5_2 shows a selection of demand elasticities for
different goods and services drawn from a variety of different studies
by economists, listed in order of increasing elasticity.

| Transatlantic air travel (economy class) | 0.12              |
| Rail transit (rush hour)               | 0.15                |
| Electricity                           | 0.20                |

| Beef                                  | 0.59                |
| Transatlantic air travel (business class) | 0.62              |
| Kitchen and household appliances      | 0.63                |

| Chicken                               | 0.64               |
| Soft drinks                           | 0.70               |

| New vehicle                           | 0.87               |
| Rail transit (off-peak)               | 1.00               |
| Computer                              | 1.44               |
| Cable TV (basic urban)                 | 1.51               |
| Cable TV (premium)                     | 1.77               |
| Restaurant meals                      | 2.27               |

: Some Selected Elasticities of Demand {#tbl-table_5_2}

Note that demand for necessities such as housing and electricity is
inelastic, while items that are not necessities such as restaurant meals
are more price-sensitive. If the price of a restaurant meal increases by
10%, the quantity demanded will decrease by 22.7%. A 10% increase in the
price of housing will cause only a slight decrease of 1.2% in the
quantity of housing demanded.

Read this [article](https://business.time.com/2013/02/19/movie-ticket-prices-hit-all-time-high-in-2012-why-thats-probably-good-for-moviegoers/) for an example
of price elasticity that may have affected you.

#### Does Raising Price Bring in More Revenue?

Imagine that a band on tour is playing in an indoor arena with 15,000
seats. To keep this example simple, assume that the band keeps all the
money from ticket sales. Assume further that the band pays the costs for
its appearance, but that these costs, like travel, and setting up the
stage, are the same regardless of how many people are in the audience.
Finally, assume that all the tickets have the same price. (The same
insights apply if ticket prices are more expensive for some seats than
for others, but the calculations become more complicated.) The band
knows that it faces a downward-sloping demand curve; that is, if the
band raises the ticket price, it will sell fewer seats. How should the
band set the ticket price to generate the most total revenue, which in
this example, because costs are fixed, will also mean the highest
profits for the band? Should the band sell more tickets at a lower price
or fewer tickets at a higher price?

The key concept in thinking about collecting the most revenue is the
price elasticity of demand. Total revenue is price times the quantity of
tickets sold. Imagine that the band starts off thinking about a certain
price, which will result in the sale of a certain quantity of tickets.
The three possibilities are in @tbl-table_5_3. If demand is
elastic at that price level, then the band should cut the price, because
the percentage drop in price will result in an even larger percentage
increase in the quantity sold---thus raising total revenue. However, if
demand is inelastic at that original quantity level, then the band
should raise the ticket price, because a certain percentage increase in
price will result in a smaller percentage decrease in the quantity
sold---and total revenue will rise. If demand has a unitary elasticity
at that quantity, then an equal percentage change in quantity will
offset a moderate percentage change in the price---so the band will earn
the same revenue whether it (moderately) increases or decreases the
ticket price.


| If Demand Is . . . | Then . . . | Therefore . . . |
|--------------------|------------|------------------|
| Elastic            | % "change in Qd" > % "change in P"  | A given % rise in P will be more than offset by a larger % fall in Q so that total revenue (P Ã— Q) falls. |
| Unitary            | % "change in Qd" = % "change in P"  | A given % rise in P will be exactly offset by an equal % fall in Q so that total revenue (P Ã— Q) is unchanged. |
| Inelastic          | % "change in Qd" < % "change in P"  | A given % rise in P will cause a smaller % fall in Q so that total revenue (P Ã— Q) rises. |

: Will the Band Earn More Revenue by Changing Ticket Price {#tbl-table_5_3}

What if the band keeps cutting price, because demand is elastic, until
it reaches a level where it sells all 15,000 seats in the available
arena? If demand remains elastic at that quantity, the band might try to
move to a bigger arena, so that it could slash ticket prices further and
see a larger percentage increase in the quantity of tickets sold.
However, if the 15,000-seat arena is all that is available or if a
larger arena would add substantially to costs, then this option may not
work.

Conversely, a few bands are so famous, or have such fanatical
followings, that demand for tickets may be inelastic right up to the
point where the arena is full. These bands can, if they wish, keep
raising the ticket price. Ironically, some of the most popular bands
could make more revenue by setting prices so high that the arena is not
full---but those who buy the tickets would have to pay very high prices.
However, bands sometimes choose to sell tickets for less than the
absolute maximum they might be able to charge, often in the hope that
fans will feel happier and spend more on recordings, T-shirts, and other
paraphernalia.

#### Can Businesses Pass Costs on to Consumers?

Most businesses face a day-to-day struggle to figure out ways to produce
at a lower cost, as one pathway to their goal of earning higher profits.
However, in some cases, the price of a key input over which the firm has
no control may rise. For example, many chemical companies use petroleum
as a key input, but they have no control over the world market price for
crude oil. Coffee shops use coffee as a key input, but they have no
control over the world market price of coffee. If the cost of a key
input rises, can the firm pass those higher costs along to consumers in
the form of higher prices? Conversely, if new and less expensive ways of
producing are invented, can the firm keep the benefits in the form of
higher profits, or will the market pressure them to pass the gains along
to consumers in the form of lower prices? The price elasticity of demand
plays a key role in answering these questions.

Imagine that as a consumer of legal pharmaceutical products, you read a
newspaper story that a technological breakthrough in the production of
aspirin has occurred, so that every aspirin factory can now produce
aspirin more cheaply. What does this discovery mean to you? [Figure 5.8](#fig-5_8) illustrates two possibilities. In [Figure 5.8](#fig-5_8) (a), the demand curve is highly inelastic. In
this case, a technological breakthrough that shifts supply to the right,
from S~0~ to S~1~, so that the equilibrium shifts from E~0~ to E~1~,
creates a substantially lower price for the product with relatively
little impact on the quantity sold. In [Figure 5.8](#fig-5_8)
(b), the demand curve is highly elastic. In this case, the technological
breakthrough leads to a much greater quantity sold in the market at very
close to the original price. Consumers benefit more, in general, when
the demand curve is more inelastic because the shift in the supply
results in a much lower price for consumers.

![](media/5-3-elasticity-and-pricing_rId27.jpeg){width="4.88in" height="2.935in" #fig-5_8}

Figure 5.8 Passing along Cost Savings to Consumers Cost-saving gains
cause supply to shift out to the right from S~0~ to S~1~; that is, at
any given price, firms will be willing to supply a greater quantity. If
demand is inelastic, as in (a), the result of this cost-saving
technological improvement will be substantially lower prices. If demand
is elastic, as in (b), the result will be only slightly lower prices.
Consumers benefit in either case, from a greater quantity at a lower
price, but the benefit is greater when demand is inelastic, as in (a).

Aspirin producers may find themselves in a nasty bind here. The
situation in [Figure 5.8](#fig-5_8), with extremely inelastic
demand, means that a new invention may cause the price to drop
dramatically while quantity changes little. As a result, the new
production technology can lead to a drop in the revenue that firms earn
from aspirin sales. However, if strong competition exists between
aspirin producers, each producer may have little choice but to search
for and implement any breakthrough that allows it to reduce production
costs. After all, if one firm decides not to implement such a
cost-saving technology, other firms that do can drive them out of
business.

Since demand for food is generally inelastic, farmers may often face the
situation in [Figure 5.8](#fig-5_8) (a). That is, a surge in
production leads to a severe drop in price that can actually decrease
the total revenue that farmers receive. Conversely, poor weather or
other conditions that cause a terrible year for farm production can
sharply raise prices so that the total revenue that the farmer receives
increases. The Clear It Up box discusses how these issues relate to
coffee.

#### Clear It Up {#clear-it-up .Heading3Grey}

##### How do coffee prices fluctuate? {#how-do-coffee-prices-fluctuate .Heading4Grey}

Coffee is an international crop. The top five coffee-exporting nations
are Brazil, Vietnam, Colombia, Indonesia, and Ethiopia. In these nations
and others, 20 million families depend on selling coffee beans as their
main source of income. These families are exposed to enormous risk,
because the world price of coffee bounces up and down. For example, in
1993, the world price of coffee was about 50 cents per pound. In 1995 it
was four times as high, at \$2 per pound. By 1997 it had fallen by half
to \$1.00 per pound. In 1998 it leaped back up to \$2 per pound. By 2001
it had fallen back to 46 cents a pound. By early 2011 it rose to about
\$2.31 per pound. By the end of 2012, the price had fallen back to about
\$1.31 per pound. Since then, the price of coffee has continued to
fluctuate.

The reason for these price fluctuations lies in a combination of
inelastic demand and shifts in supply. The elasticity of coffee demand
is only about 0.3; that is, a 10% rise in the price of coffee leads to a
decline of about 3% in the quantity of coffee consumed. When a major
frost hit the Brazilian coffee crop in 1994, coffee supply shifted to
the left with an inelastic demand curve, leading to much higher prices.
Conversely, when Vietnam entered the world coffee market as a major
producer in the late 1990s, the supply curve shifted out to the right.
With a highly inelastic demand curve, coffee prices fell dramatically.
[Figure 5.8](#fig-5_8) (a) illustrates this situation.

Elasticity also reveals whether firms can pass higher costs that they
incur on to consumers. Addictive substances, for which demand is
inelastic, are products for which producers can pass higher costs on to
consumers. For example, the demand for cigarettes is relatively
inelastic among regular smokers who are somewhat addicted. Economic
research suggests that increasing cigarette prices by 10% leads to about
a 3% reduction in the quantity of cigarettes that adults smoke, so the
elasticity of demand for cigarettes is 0.3. If society increases taxes
on companies that produce cigarettes, the result will be, as in [Figure 5.9](#fig-5_9) (a), that the supply curve shifts from S~0~ to
S~1~. However, as the equilibrium moves from E~0~ to E~1~, governments
mainly pass along these taxes to consumers in the form of higher prices.
These higher taxes on cigarettes will raise tax revenue for the
government, but they will not much affect the quantity of smoking.

If the goal is to reduce the quantity of cigarettes demanded, we must
achieve it by shifting this inelastic demand back to the left, perhaps
with public programs to discourage cigarette use or to help people to
quit. For example, anti-smoking advertising campaigns have shown some
ability to reduce smoking. However, if cigarette demand were more
elastic, as in [Figure 5.9](#fig-5_9) (b), then an increase in
taxes that shifts supply from S~0~ to S~1~ and equilibrium from E~0~ to
E~1~ would reduce the quantity of cigarettes smoked substantially. Youth
smoking seems to be more elastic than adult smoking---that is, the
quantity of youth smoking will fall by a greater percentage than the
quantity of adult smoking in response to a given percentage increase in
price.

![](media/5-3-elasticity-and-pricing_rId31.jpeg){width="6.5in" height="2.965in" #fig-5_9}

Figure 5.9 Passing along Higher Costs to Consumers Higher costs, like a
higher tax on cigarette companies for the example we gave in the text,
lead supply to shift to the left. This shift is identical in (a) and
(b). However, in (a), where demand is inelastic, companies largely can
pass the cost increase along to consumers in the form of higher prices,
without much of a decline in equilibrium quantity. In (b), demand is
elastic, so the shift in supply results primarily in a lower equilibrium
quantity. Consumers do not benefit in either case, but in (a), they pay
a higher price for the same quantity, while in (b), they must buy a
lower quantity (and presumably needing to shift their consumption
elsewhere).

#### Elasticity and Tax Incidence

The example of cigarette taxes demonstrated that because demand is
inelastic, taxes are not effective at reducing the equilibrium quantity
of smoking, and they are mainly passed along to consumers in the form of
higher prices. The analysis, or manner, of how a tax burden is divided
between consumers and producers is called tax incidence. Typically, the
tax incidence, or burden, falls both on the consumers and producers of
the taxed good. However, if one wants to predict which group will bear
most of the burden, all one needs to do is examine the elasticity of
demand and supply. In the tobacco example, the tax burden falls on the
most inelastic side of the market.

If demand is more inelastic than supply, consumers bear most of the tax
burden, and if supply is more inelastic than demand, sellers bear most
of the tax burden.

The intuition for this is simple. When the demand is inelastic,
consumers are not very responsive to price changes, and the quantity
demanded reduces only modestly when the tax is introduced. In the case
of smoking, the demand is inelastic because consumers are addicted to
the product. The government can then pass the tax burden along to
consumers in the form of higher prices, without much of a decline in the
equilibrium quantity.

Similarly, when a government introduces a tax in a market with an
inelastic supply, such as, for example, beachfront hotels, and sellers
have no alternative than to accept lower prices for their business,
taxes do not greatly affect the equilibrium quantity. The tax burden now
passes on to the sellers. If the supply was elastic and sellers had the
possibility of reorganizing their businesses to avoid supplying the
taxed good, the tax burden on the sellers would be much smaller. The tax
would result in a much lower quantity sold instead of lower prices
received. [Figure 5.10](#fig-5_10) illustrates this relationship
between the tax incidence and elasticity of demand and supply.

![](media/5-3-elasticity-and-pricing_rId37.jpeg){width="6.5in" height="2.74in" #fig-5_10}

Figure 5.10 Elasticity and Tax Incidence An excise tax introduces a
wedge between the price paid by consumers (Pc) and the price received by
producers (Pp). The vertical distance between Pc and Pp is the amount of
the tax per unit. Pe is the equilibrium price prior to introduction of
the tax. (a) When the demand is more elastic than supply, the tax
incidence on consumers Pc -- Pe is lower than the tax incidence on
producers Pe -- Pp. (b) When the supply is more elastic than demand, the
tax incidence on consumers Pc -- Pe is larger than the tax incidence on
producers Pe -- Pp. The more elastic the demand and supply curves, the
lower the tax revenue.

In [Figure 5.10](#fig-5_10) (a), the supply is inelastic and the
demand is elastic, such as in the example of beachfront hotels. While
consumers may have other vacation choices, sellers can't easily move
their businesses. By introducing a tax, the government essentially
creates a wedge between the price paid by consumers Pc and the price
received by producers Pp. In other words, of the total price paid by
consumers, part is retained by the sellers and part is paid to the
government in the form of a tax. The distance between Pc and Pp is the
tax rate. The new market price is Pc, but sellers receive only Pp per
unit sold, as they pay Pc-Pp to the government. Since we can view a tax
as raising the costs of production, this could also be represented by a
leftward shift of the supply curve, where the new supply curve would
intercept the demand at the new quantity Qt. For simplicity, [Figure
5.10](#CNX_Econ_C05_025) omits the shift in the supply curve.

The tax revenue is given by the shaded area, which we obtain by
multiplying the tax per unit by the total quantity sold Qt. The tax
incidence on the consumers is given by the difference between the price
paid Pc and the initial equilibrium price Pe. The tax incidence on the
sellers is given by the difference between the initial equilibrium price
Pe and the price they receive after the tax is introduced Pp. In [Figure
5.10](#fig-5_10) (a), the tax burden falls disproportionately on
the sellers, and a larger proportion of the tax revenue (the shaded
area) is due to the resulting lower price received by the sellers than
by the resulting higher prices paid by the buyers. [Figure
5.10](#fig-5_10) (b) describes the example of the tobacco excise
tax where the supply is more elastic than demand. The tax incidence now
falls disproportionately on consumers, as shown by the large difference
between the price they pay, Pc, and the initial equilibrium price, Pe.
Sellers receive a lower price than before the tax, but this difference
is much smaller than the change in consumers' price. From this analysis
one can also predict whether a tax is likely to create a large revenue
or not. The more elastic the demand curve, the more likely that
consumers will reduce quantity instead of paying higher prices. The more
elastic the supply curve, the more likely that sellers will reduce the
quantity sold, instead of taking lower prices. In a market where both
the demand and supply are very elastic, the imposition of an excise tax
generates low revenue.

Some believe that excise taxes hurt mainly the specific industries they
target. For example, the medical device excise tax, which was
implemented in 2013, has been controversial for it can delay industry
profitability and therefore hamper start-ups and medical innovation. The
tax was repealed in late 2019. However, whether the tax burden falls
mostly on the medical device industry or on the patients depends simply
on the elasticity of demand and supply.

#### Long-Run vs. Short-Run Impact

Elasticities are often lower in the short run than in the long run. On
the demand side of the market, it can sometimes be difficult to change
Qd in the short run, but easier in the long run. Consumption of energy
is a clear example. In the short run, it is not easy for a person to
make substantial changes in energy consumption. Maybe you can carpool to
work sometimes or adjust your home thermostat by a few degrees if the
cost of energy rises, but that is about all. However, in the long run
you can purchase a car that gets more miles to the gallon, choose a job
that is closer to where you live, buy more energy-efficient home
appliances, or install more insulation in your home. As a result, the
elasticity of demand for energy is somewhat inelastic in the short run,
but much more elastic in the long run.

[Figure 5.11](#fig-5_11) is an example, based roughly on
historical experience, for the responsiveness of Qd to price changes. In
1973, the price of crude oil was \$12 per barrel and total consumption
in the U.S. economy was 17 million barrels per day. That year, the
nations who were members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC) cut off oil exports to the United States for six months
because the Arab members of OPEC disagreed with the U.S. support for
Israel. OPEC did not bring exports back to their earlier levels until
1975---a policy that we can interpret as a shift of the supply curve to
the left in the U.S. petroleum market. [Figure 5.11](#fig-5_11)
(a) and [Figure 5.11](#fig-5_11) (b) show the same original
equilibrium point and the same identical shift of a supply curve to the
left from S~0~ to S~1~.

![](media/5-3-elasticity-and-pricing_rId42.jpeg){width="6.5in" height="2.985in" #fig-5_11}

Figure 5.11 How a Shift in Supply Can Affect Price or Quantity The
intersection (E~0~) between demand curve D and supply curve S~0~ is the
same in both (a) and (b). The shift of supply to the left from S~0~ to
S~1~ is identical in both (a) and (b). The new equilibrium (E~1~) has a
higher price and a lower quantity than the original equilibrium (E~0~)
in both (a) and (b). However, the shape of the demand curve D is
different in (a) and (b), being more elastic in (b) than in (a). As a
result, the shift in supply can result either in a new equilibrium with
a much higher price and an only slightly smaller quantity, as in (a),
with more inelastic demand, or in a new equilibrium with only a small
increase in price and a relatively larger reduction in quantity, as in
(b), with more elastic demand.

[Figure 5.11](#fig-5_11) (a) shows inelastic demand for oil in
the short run similar to that which existed for the United States in
1973. In [Figure 5.11](#fig-5_11) (a), the new equilibrium
(E~1~) occurs at a price of \$25 per barrel, roughly double the price
before the OPEC shock, and an equilibrium quantity of 16 million barrels
per day. [Figure 5.11](#fig-5_11) (b) shows what the outcome
would have been if the U.S. demand for oil had been more elastic, a
result more likely over the long term. This alternative equilibrium
(E~1~) would have resulted in a smaller price increase to \$14 per
barrel and larger reduction in equilibrium quantity to 13 million
barrels per day. In 1983, for example, U.S. petroleum consumption was
15.3 million barrels a day, which was lower than in 1973 or 1975. U.S.
petroleum consumption was down even though the U.S. economy was about
one-fourth larger in 1983 than it had been in 1973. The primary reason
for the lower quantity was that higher energy prices spurred
conservation efforts, and after a decade of home insulation, more
fuel-efficient cars, more efficient appliances and machinery, and other
fuel-conserving choices, the demand curve for energy had become more
elastic.

On the supply side of markets, producers of goods and services typically
find it easier to expand production in the long term of several years
rather than in the short run of a few months. After all, in the short
run it can be costly or difficult to build a new factory, hire many new
workers, or open new stores. However, over a few years, all of these are
possible.

In most markets for goods and services, prices bounce up and down more
than quantities in the short run, but quantities often move more than
prices in the long run. The underlying reason for this pattern is that
supply and demand are often inelastic in the short run, so that shifts
in either demand or supply can cause a relatively greater change in
prices. However, since supply and demand are more elastic in the long
run, the long-run movements in prices are more muted, while quantity
adjusts more easily in the long run.


### 5.4 Elasticity in Areas Other Than Price

#### Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

-   Calculate the income elasticity of demand and the cross-price
    elasticity of demand
-   Calculate the elasticity in labor and financial capital markets
    through an understanding of the elasticity of labor supply and the
    elasticity of savings
-   Apply concepts of price elasticity to real-world situations

The basic idea of elasticity---how a percentage change in one variable
causes a percentage change in another variable---does not just apply to
the responsiveness of quantity supplied and quantity demanded to changes
in the price of a product. Recall that quantity demanded (Qd) depends on
income, tastes and preferences, the prices of related goods, and so on,
as well as price. Similarly, quantity supplied (Qs) depends on factors
such as the cost of production, as well as price. We can measure
elasticity for any determinant of quantity supplied and quantity
demanded, not just the price.

#### Income Elasticity of Demand

The income elasticity of demand is the percentage change in quantity
demanded divided by the percentage change in income.

$$
\text { Income elasticity of demand }=\frac{\% \text { change in quantity demanded }}{\% \text { change in income }}
$$

For most products, most of the time, the income elasticity of demand is
positive: that is, a rise in income will cause an increase in the
quantity demanded. This pattern is common enough that we refer to these
goods as normal goods. However, for a few goods, an increase in income
means that one might purchase less of the good. For example, those with
a higher income might buy fewer hamburgers, because they are buying more
steak instead, or those with a higher income might buy less cheap wine
and more imported beer. When the income elasticity of demand is
negative, we call the good an inferior good.

We introduced the concepts of normal and inferior goods in @sec-chapter-3.
A higher level of income causes a demand curve to shift to the right for
a normal good, which means that the income elasticity of demand is
positive. How far the demand shifts depends on the income elasticity of
demand. A higher income elasticity means a larger shift. However, for an
inferior good, that is, when the income elasticity of demand is
negative, a higher level of income would cause the demand curve for that
good to shift to the left. Again, how much it shifts depends on how
large the (negative) income elasticity is.

#### Cross-Price Elasticity of Demand

A change in the price of one good can shift the quantity demanded for
another good. If the two goods are complements, like bread and peanut
butter, then a drop in the price of one good will lead to an increase in
the quantity demanded of the other good. However, if the two goods are
substitutes, like plane tickets and train tickets, then a drop in the
price of one good will cause people to substitute toward that good, and
to reduce consumption of the other good. Cheaper plane tickets lead to
fewer train tickets, and vice versa.

The cross-price elasticity of demand puts some meat on the bones of
these ideas. The term "cross-price" refers to the idea that the price of
one good is affecting the quantity demanded of a different good.
Specifically, the cross-price elasticity of demand is the percentage
change in the quantity of good A that is demanded as a result of a
percentage change in the price of good B.

$$
\text { Cross-price elasticity of demand }=\frac{\% \text { change in } \mathrm{Qd} \text { of good } \mathrm{A}}{\% \text { change in price of good } \mathrm{B}}
$$

Substitute goods have positive cross-price elasticities of demand: if
good A is a substitute for good B, like coffee and tea, then a higher
price for B will mean a greater quantity consumed of A. Complement goods
have negative cross-price elasticities: if good A is a complement for
good B, like coffee and sugar, then a higher price for B will mean a
lower quantity consumed of A.

#### Elasticity in Labor and Financial Capital Markets

The concept of elasticity applies to any market, not just markets for
goods and services. In the labor market, for example, the wage
elasticity of labor supply---that is, the percentage change in hours
worked divided by the percentage change in wages---will reflect the
shape of the labor supply curve. Specifically:

$$
\text { Elasticity of labor supply }=\frac{\% \text { change in quantity of labor supplied }}{\% \text { change in wage }}
$$

The wage elasticity of labor supply for teenage workers is generally
fairly elastic: that is, a certain percentage change in wages will lead
to a larger percentage change in the quantity of hours worked.
Conversely, the wage elasticity of labor supply for adult workers in
their thirties and forties is fairly inelastic. When wages move up or
down by a certain percentage amount, the quantity of hours that adults
in their prime earning years are willing to supply changes but by a
lesser percentage amount.

In markets for financial capital, the elasticity of savings---that is,
the percentage change in the quantity of savings divided by the
percentage change in interest rates---will describe the shape of the
supply curve for financial capital. That is:

$$
\text { Elasticity of savings }=\frac{\% \text { change in quantity of financial savings }}{\% \text { change in interest rate }}
$$

Sometimes laws are proposed that seek to increase the quantity of
savings by offering tax breaks so that the return on savings is higher.
Such a policy will have a comparatively large impact on increasing the
quantity saved if the supply curve for financial capital is elastic,
because then a given percentage increase in the return to savings will
cause a higher percentage increase in the quantity of savings. However,
if the supply curve for financial capital is highly inelastic, then a
percentage increase in the return to savings will cause only a small
increase in the quantity of savings. The evidence on the supply curve of
financial capital is controversial but, at least in the short run, the
elasticity of savings with respect to the interest rate appears fairly
inelastic.

#### Expanding the Concept of Elasticity

The elasticity concept does not even need to relate to a typical supply
or demand curve at all. For example, imagine that you are studying
whether the Internal Revenue Service should spend more money on auditing
tax returns. We can frame the question in terms of the elasticity of tax
collections with respect to spending on tax enforcement; that is, what
is the percentage change in tax collections derived from a given
percentage change in spending on tax enforcement?

With all of the elasticity concepts that we have just described, some of
which are in @tbl-table_5_4, the possibility of confusion
arises. When you hear the phrases "elasticity of demand" or "elasticity
of supply," they refer to the elasticity with respect to price.
Sometimes, either to be extremely clear or because economists are
discussing a wide variety of elasticities, we will call the elasticity
of demand or the demand elasticity the price elasticity of demand or the
"elasticity of demand with respect to price." Similarly, economists
sometimes use the term elasticity of supply or the supply elasticity, to
avoid any possibility of confusion, the price elasticity of supply or
"the elasticity of supply with respect to price." However, in whatever
context, the idea of elasticity always refers to percentage change in
one variable, almost always a price or money variable, and how it causes
a percentage change in another variable, typically a quantity variable
of some kind.

##### That Will Be How Much? {#that-will-be-how-much .Heading4Grey}

How did the 60% price increase in 2011 end up for Netflix? It has been a
very bumpy ride.

Before the price increase, there were about 24.6 million U.S.
subscribers. After the price increase, 810,000 infuriated U.S. consumers
canceled their Netflix subscriptions, dropping the total number of
subscribers to 23.79 million. Fast forward to June 2013, when there were
36 million streaming Netflix subscribers in the United States. This was
an increase of 11.4 million subscribers since the price increase---an
average per quarter growth of about 1.6 million. This growth is less
than the 2 million per quarter increases Netflix experienced in the
fourth quarter of 2010 and the first quarter of 2011.

During the first year after the price increase, the firm's stock price
(a measure of future expectations for the firm) fell from about \$33.60
per share per share to just under \$7.80. By the end of 2016, however,
the stock price was at \$123 per share. By the end of 2021, the stock
price was just over \$600 per share, and Netflix had more than 214
million subscribers in fifty countries.

What happened? Obviously, Netflix company officials understood the law
of demand. Company officials reported, when announcing the price
increase, this could result in the loss of about 600,000 existing
subscribers. Using the elasticity of demand formula, it is easy to see
company officials expected an inelastic response:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& =\frac{-600,000 /[(24 \text { million }+24.6 \text { million }) / 2]}{\$ 6 /[(\$ 10+\$ 16) / 2]} \\
& =\frac{-600,000 / 24.3 \text { million }}{\$ 6 / \$ 13} \\
& =\frac{-0.025}{0.46} \\
& =-0.05
\end{aligned}
$$

In addition, Netflix officials had anticipated the price increase would
have little impact on attracting new customers. Netflix anticipated
adding up to 1.29 million new subscribers in the third quarter of 2011.
It is true this was slower growth than the firm had experienced---about
2 million per quarter.

Why was the estimate of customers leaving so far off? In the more than
two decades since Netflix had been founded, there was an increase in the
number of close, but not perfect, substitutes. Consumers now had choices
ranging from Vudu, Amazon Prime, Hulu, and Redbox, to retail stores.
Jaime Weinman reported in *Maclean's* that Redbox kiosks are "a
five-minute drive for less from 68 percent of Americans, and it seems
that many people still find a five-minute drive more convenient than
loading up a movie online." It seems that in 2012, many consumers still
preferred a physical DVD disk over streaming video.

What missteps did the Netflix management make? In addition to misjudging
the elasticity of demand, by failing to account for close substitutes,
it seems they may have also misjudged customers' preferences and tastes.
However, the very substantial increase over time in the number of
Netflix subscribers suggests that the preference for streaming video may
well have overtaken the preference for physical DVD disks. Netflix, the
source of numerous late night talk show laughs and jabs in 2011, may yet
have the last laugh.
