# Indifference Curves {#sec-appendix-b}

Economists use a vocabulary of maximizing utility to describe people's
preferences. In @sec-chapter-6,
the level of utility that a person receives is described in numerical
terms. This appendix presents an alternative approach to describing
personal preferences, called indifference curves, which avoids any need
for using numbers to measure utility. By setting aside the assumption of
putting a numerical valuation on utility---an assumption that many
students and economists find uncomfortably unrealistic---the
indifference curve framework helps to clarify the logic of the
underlying model.

## What Is an Indifference Curve?

People cannot really put a numerical value on their level of
satisfaction. However, they can, and do, identify what choices would
give them more, or less, or the same amount of satisfaction. An
indifference curve shows combinations of goods that provide an equal
level of utility or satisfaction. For example, [Figure
B1](#fig-append_b_1) presents three indifference curves that represent
Lilly's preferences for the tradeoffs that she faces in her two main
relaxation activities: eating doughnuts and reading paperback books.
Each indifference curve (Ul, Um, and Uh) represents one level of
utility. First we will explore the meaning of one particular
indifference curve and then we will look at the indifference curves as a
group.

Figure B1 Lilly's Indifference Curves Lilly would receive equal utility
from all points on a given indifference curve. Any points on the highest
indifference curve Uh, like F, provide greater utility than any points
like A, B, C, and D on the middle indifference curve Um. Similarly, any
points on the middle indifference curve Um provide greater utility than
any points on the lowest indifference curve Ul.

**The Shape of an Indifference Curve**

The indifference curve Um has four points labeled on it: A, B, C, and D.
Since an indifference curve represents a set of choices that have the
same level of utility, Lilly must receive an equal amount of utility,
judged according to her personal preferences, from two books and 120
doughnuts (point A), from three books and 84 doughnuts (point B) from 11
books and 40 doughnuts (point C) or from 12 books and 35 doughnuts
(point D). She would also receive the same utility from any of the
unlabeled intermediate points along this indifference curve.

Indifference curves have a roughly similar shape in two ways: 1) they
are downward sloping from left to right; 2) they are convex with respect
to the origin. In other words, they are steeper on the left and flatter
on the right. The downward slope of the indifference curve means that
Lilly must trade off less of one good to get more of the other, while
holding utility constant. For example, points A and B sit on the same
indifference curve Um, which means that they provide Lilly with the same
level of utility. Thus, the marginal utility that Lilly would gain from,
say, increasing her consumption of books from two to three must be equal
to the marginal utility that she would lose if her consumption of
doughnuts was cut from 120 to 84---so that her overall utility remains
unchanged between points A and B. Indeed, the slope along an
indifference curve as the marginal rate of substitution, which is the
rate at which a person is willing to trade one good for another so that
utility will remain the same.

Indifference curves like Um are steeper on the left and flatter on the
right. The reason behind this shape involves diminishing marginal
utility---the notion that as a person consumes more of a good, the
marginal utility from each additional unit becomes lower. Compare two
different choices between points that all provide Lilly an equal amount
of utility along the indifference curve Um: the choice between A and B,
and between C and D. In both choices, Lilly consumes one more book, but
between A and B her consumption of doughnuts falls by 36 (from 120 to
84) and between C and D it falls by only five (from 40 to 35). The
reason for this difference is that points A and C are different starting
points, and thus have different implications for marginal utility. At
point A, Lilly has few books and many doughnuts. Thus, her marginal
utility from an extra book will be relatively high while the marginal
utility of additional doughnuts is relatively low---so on the margin, it
will take a relatively large number of doughnuts to offset the utility
from the marginal book. At point C, however, Lilly has many books and
few doughnuts. From this starting point, her marginal utility gained
from extra books will be relatively low, while the marginal utility lost
from additional doughnuts would be relatively high---so on the margin,
it will take a relatively smaller number of doughnuts to offset the
change of one marginal book. In short, the slope of the indifference
curve changes because the marginal rate of substitution---that is, the
quantity of one good that would be traded for the other good to keep
utility constant---also changes, as a result of diminishing marginal
utility of both goods.

**The Field of Indifference Curves**

Each indifference curve represents the choices that provide a single
level of utility. Every level of utility will have its own indifference
curve. Thus, Lilly's preferences will include an infinite number of
indifference curves lying nestled together on the diagram---even though
only three of the indifference curves, representing three levels of
utility, appear on [Figure B1](#fig-append_b_1). In other words, an
infinite number of indifference curves are not drawn on this
diagram---but you should remember that they exist.

Higher indifference curves represent a greater level of utility than
lower ones. In [Figure B1](#fig-append_b_1), indifference curve Ul can
be thought of as a "low" level of utility, while Um is a "medium" level
of utility and Uh is a "high" level of utility. All of the choices on
indifference curve Uh are preferred to all of the choices on
indifference curve Um, which in turn are preferred to all of the choices
on Ul.

To understand why higher indifference curves are preferred to lower
ones, compare point B on indifference curve Um to point F on
indifference curve Uh. Point F has greater consumption of both books
(five to three) and doughnuts (100 to 84), so point F is clearly
preferable to point B. Given the definition of an indifference
curve---that all the points on the curve have the same level of
utility---if point F on indifference curve Uh is preferred to point B on
indifference curve Um, then it must be true that all points on
indifference curve Uh have a higher level of utility than all points on
Um. More generally, for any point on a lower indifference curve, like
Ul, you can identify a point on a higher indifference curve like Um or
Uh that has a higher consumption of both goods. Since one point on the
higher indifference curve is preferred to one point on the lower curve,
and since all the points on a given indifference curve have the same
level of utility, it must be true that all points on higher indifference
curves have greater utility than all points on lower indifference
curves.

These arguments about the shapes of indifference curves and about higher
or lower levels of utility do not require any numerical estimates of
utility, either by the individual or by anyone else. They are only based
on the assumptions that when people have less of one good they need more
of another good to make up for it, if they are keeping the same level of
utility, and that as people have more of a good, the marginal utility
they receive from additional units of that good will diminish. Given
these gentle assumptions, a field of indifference curves can be mapped
out to describe the preferences of any individual.

**The Individuality of Indifference Curves**

Each person determines their own preferences and utility. Thus, while
indifference curves have the same general shape---they slope down, and
the slope is steeper on the left and flatter on the right---the specific
shape of indifference curves can be different for every person. [Figure
B1](#fig-append_b_1), for example, applies only to Lilly's
preferences. Indifference curves for other people would probably travel
through different points.

## Utility-Maximizing with Indifference Curves

People seek the highest level of utility, which means that they wish to
be on the highest possible indifference curve. However, people are
limited by their budget constraints, which show what tradeoffs are
actually possible.

**Maximizing Utility at the Highest Indifference Curve**

Return to the situation of Lilly's choice between paperback books and
doughnuts. Say that books cost \$6, doughnuts are 50 cents each, and
that Lilly has \$60 to spend. This information provides the basis for
the budget line shown in [Figure B2](#fig-append_b_2). Along with the
budget line are shown the three indifference curves from [Figure B1](#fig-append_b_1). What is Lilly's utility-maximizing choice?
Several possibilities are identified in the diagram.

![](media/b-indifference-curves_rId32.jpeg){width="3.25in" height="3.45in" #fig-append_b_2}

Figure B2 Indifference Curves and a Budget Constraint Lilly's
preferences are shown by the indifference curves. Lilly's budget
constraint, given the prices of books and doughnuts and her income, is
shown by the straight line. Lilly's optimal choice will be point B,
where the budget line is tangent to the indifference curve Um. Lilly
would have more utility at a point like F on the higher indifference
curve Uh, but the budget line does not touch the higher indifference
curve Uh at any point, so she cannot afford this choice. A choice like G
is affordable to Lilly, but it lies on indifference curve Ul and thus
provides less utility than choice B, which is on indifference curve Um.

The choice of F with five books and 100 doughnuts is highly desirable,
since it is on the highest indifference curve Uh of those shown in the
diagram. However, it is not affordable given Lilly's budget constraint.
The choice of H with three books and 70 doughnuts on indifference curve
Ul is a wasteful choice, since it is inside Lilly's budget set, and as a
utility-maximizer, Lilly will always prefer a choice on the budget
constraint itself. Choices B and G are both on the opportunity set.
However, choice G of six books and 48 doughnuts is on lower indifference
curve Ul than choice B of three books and 84 doughnuts, which is on the
indifference curve Um. If Lilly were to start at choice G, and then
thought about whether the marginal utility she was deriving from
doughnuts and books, she would decide that some additional doughnuts and
fewer books would make her happier---which would cause her to move
toward her preferred choice B. Given the combination of Lilly's personal
preferences, as identified by her indifference curves, and Lilly's
opportunity set, which is determined by prices and income, B will be her
utility-maximizing choice.

The highest achievable indifference curve touches the opportunity set at
a single point of tangency. Since an infinite number of indifference
curves exist, even if only a few of them are drawn on any given diagram,
there will always exist one indifference curve that touches the budget
line at a single point of tangency. All higher indifference curves, like
Uh, will be completely above the budget line and, although the choices
on that indifference curve would provide higher utility, they are not
affordable given the budget set. All lower indifference curves, like Ul,
will cross the budget line in two separate places. When one indifference
curve crosses the budget line in two places, however, there will be
another, higher, attainable indifference curve sitting above it that
touches the budget line at only one point of tangency.

## Changes in Income

A rise in income causes the budget constraint to shift to the right. In
graphical terms, the new budget constraint will now be tangent to a
higher indifference curve, representing a higher level of utility. A
reduction in income will cause the budget constraint to shift to the
left, which will cause it to be tangent to a lower indifference curve,
representing a reduced level of utility. If income rises by, for
example, 50%, exactly how much will a person alter consumption of books
and doughnuts? Will consumption of both goods rise by 50%, or will the
quantity of one good rise substantially, while the quantity of the other
good rises only a little, or even declines?

Since personal preferences and the shape of indifference curves are
different for each individual, the response to changes in income will be
different, too. For example, consider the preferences of Manuel and
Natasha in [Figure B3](#fig-append_b_3) (a) and [Figure B3](#fig-append_b_3) (b). They each start with an identical income of
\$40, which they spend on yogurts that cost \$1 and rental movies that
cost \$4. Thus, they face identical budget constraints. However, based
on Manuel's preferences, as revealed by his indifference curves, his
utility-maximizing choice on the original budget set occurs where his
opportunity set is tangent to the highest possible indifference curve at
W, with three movies and 28 yogurts, while Natasha's utility-maximizing
choice on the original budget set at Y will be seven movies and 12
yogurts.

![](media/b-indifference-curves_rId38.jpeg){width="6.5in" height="3.45in" #fig-append_b_3}

Figure B3 Manuel and Natasha's Indifference Curves Manuel and Natasha
originally face the same budget constraints; that is, same prices and
same income. However, the indifference curves that illustrate their
preferences are not the same. (a) Manuel's original choice at W involves
more yogurt and more movies, and he reacts to the higher income by
mainly increasing consumption of movies at X. (b) Conversely, Natasha's
original choice (Y) involves relatively more movies, but she reacts to
the higher income by choosing relatively more yogurts. Even when budget
constraints are the same, personal preferences lead to different
original choices and to different reactions in response to a change in
income.

Now, say that income rises to \$60 for both Manuel and Natasha, so their
budget constraints shift to the right. As shown in [Figure
B3](#fig-append_b_3) (a), Manuel's new utility maximizing choice at X
will be seven movies and 32 yogurts---that is, Manuel will choose to
spend most of the extra income on movies. Natasha's new utility
maximizing choice at Z will be eight movies and 28 yogurts---that is,
she will choose to spend most of the extra income on yogurt. In this
way, the indifference curve approach allows for a range of possible
responses. However, if both goods are normal goods, then the typical
response to a higher level of income will be to purchase more of
them---although exactly how much more is a matter of personal
preference. If one of the goods is an inferior good, the response to a
higher level of income will be to purchase less of it.

## Responses to Price Changes: Substitution and Income Effects

A higher price for a good will cause the budget constraint to shift to
the left, so that it is tangent to a lower indifference curve
representing a reduced level of utility. Conversely, a lower price for a
good will cause the opportunity set to shift to the right, so that it is
tangent to a higher indifference curve representing an increased level
of utility. Exactly how much a change in price will lead to the quantity
demanded of each good will depend on personal preferences.

Anyone who faces a change in price will experience two interlinked
motivations: a substitution effect and an income effect. The
substitution effect is that when a good becomes more expensive, people
seek out substitutes. If oranges become more expensive, fruit-lovers
scale back on oranges and eat more apples, grapefruit, or raisins.
Conversely, when a good becomes cheaper, people substitute toward
consuming more. If oranges get cheaper, people fire up their juicing
machines and ease off on other fruits and foods. The income effect
refers to how a change in the price of a good alters the effective
buying power of one's income. If the price of a good that you have been
buying falls, then in effect your buying power has risen---you are able
to purchase more goods. Conversely, if the price of a good that you have
been buying rises, then the buying power of a given amount of income is
diminished. (One common source of confusion is that the "income effect"
does not refer to a change in actual income. Instead, it refers to the
situation in which the price of a good changes, and thus the quantities
of goods that can be purchased with a fixed amount of income change. It
might be more accurate to call the "income effect" a "buying power
effect," but the "income effect" terminology has been used for decades,
and it is not going to change during this economics course.) Whenever a
price changes, consumers feel the pull of both substitution and income
effects at the same time.

Using indifference curves, you can illustrate the substitution and
income effects on a graph. In [Figure B4](#fig-append_b_4), Ogden
faces a choice between two goods: haircuts or personal pizzas. Haircuts
cost \$20, personal pizzas cost \$6, and he has \$120 to spend.

![](media/b-indifference-curves_rId45.jpeg){width="3.25in" height="2.72in" #fig-append_b_4}

Figure B4 Substitution and Income Effects The original choice is A, the
point of tangency between the original budget constraint and
indifference curve. The new choice is B, the point of tangency between
the new budget constraint and the lower indifference curve. Point C is
the tangency between the dashed line, where the slope shows the new
higher price of haircuts, and the original indifference curve. The
substitution effect is the shift from A to C, which means getting fewer
haircuts and more pizza. The income effect is the shift from C to B;
that is, the reduction in buying power that causes a shift from the
higher indifference curve to the lower indifference curve, with relative
prices remaining unchanged. The income effect results in less consumed
of both goods. Both substitution and income effects cause fewer haircuts
to be consumed. For pizza, in this case, the substitution effect and
income effect cancel out, leading to the same amount of pizza consumed.

The price of haircuts rises to \$30. Ogden starts at choice A on the
higher opportunity set and the higher indifference curve. After the
price of haircuts increases, he chooses B on the lower opportunity set
and the lower indifference curve. Point B with two haircuts and 10
personal pizzas is immediately below point A with three haircuts and 10
personal pizzas, showing that Ogden reacted to a higher price of
haircuts by cutting back only on haircuts, while leaving his consumption
of pizza unchanged.

The dashed line in the diagram, and point C, are used to separate the
substitution effect and the income effect. To understand their function,
start by thinking about the substitution effect with this question: How
would Ogden change his consumption if the relative prices of the two
goods changed, but this change in relative prices did not affect his
utility? The slope of the budget constraint is determined by the
relative price of the two goods; thus, the slope of the original budget
line is determined by the original relative prices, while the slope of
the new budget line is determined by the new relative prices. With this
thought in mind, the dashed line is a graphical tool inserted in a
specific way: It is inserted so that it is parallel with the new budget
constraint, so it reflects the new relative prices, but it is tangent to
the original indifference curve, so it reflects the original level of
utility or buying power.

Thus, the movement from the original choice (A) to point C is a
substitution effect; it shows the choice that Ogden would make if
relative prices shifted (as shown by the different slope between the
original budget set and the dashed line) but if buying power did not
shift (as shown by being tangent to the original indifference curve).
The substitution effect will encourage people to shift away from the
good which has become relatively more expensive---in Ogden's case, the
haircuts on the vertical axis---and toward the good which has become
relatively less expensive---in this case, the pizza on the vertical
axis. The two arrows labeled with "s" for "substitution effect," one on
each axis, show the direction of this movement.

The income effect is the movement from point C to B, which shows how
Ogden reacts to a reduction in his buying power from the higher
indifference curve to the lower indifference curve, but holding constant
the relative prices (because the dashed line has the same slope as the
new budget constraint). In this case, where the price of one good
increases, buying power is reduced, so the income effect means that
consumption of both goods should fall (if they are both normal goods,
which it is reasonable to assume unless there is reason to believe
otherwise). The two arrows labeled with "i" for "income effect," one on
each axis, show the direction of this income effect movement.

Now, put the substitution and income effects together. When the price of
pizza increased, Ogden consumed less of it, for two reasons shown in the
exhibit: the substitution effect of the higher price led him to consume
less and the income effect of the higher price also led him to consume
less. However, when the price of pizza increased, Ogden consumed the
same quantity of haircuts. The substitution effect of a higher price for
pizza meant that haircuts became relatively less expensive (compared to
pizza), and this factor, taken alone, would have encouraged Ogden to
consume more haircuts. However, the income effect of a higher price for
pizza meant that he wished to consume less of both goods, and this
factor, taken alone, would have encouraged Ogden to consume fewer
haircuts. As shown in [Figure B4](#fig-append_b_4), in this particular
example the substitution effect and income effect on Ogden's consumption
of haircuts are offsetting---so he ends up consuming the same quantity
of haircuts after the price increase for pizza as before.

The size of these income and substitution effects will differ from
person to person, depending on individual preferences. For example, if
Ogden's substitution effect away from pizza and toward haircuts is
especially strong, and outweighs the income effect, then a higher price
for pizza might lead to increased consumption of haircuts. This case
would be drawn on the graph so that the point of tangency between the
new budget constraint and the relevant indifference curve occurred below
point B and to the right. Conversely, if the substitution effect away
from pizza and toward haircuts is not as strong, and the income effect
on is relatively stronger, then Ogden will be more likely to react to
the higher price of pizza by consuming less of both goods. In this case,
his optimal choice after the price change will be above and to the left
of choice B on the new budget constraint.

Although the substitution and income effects are often discussed as a
sequence of events, it should be remembered that they are twin
components of a single cause---a change in price. Although you can
analyze them separately, the two effects are always proceeding hand in
hand, happening at the same time.

## Indifference Curves with Labor-Leisure and Intertemporal Choices

The concept of an indifference curve applies to tradeoffs in any
household choice, including the labor-leisure choice or the
intertemporal choice between present and future consumption. In the
labor-leisure choice, each indifference curve shows the combinations of
leisure and income that provide a certain level of utility. In an
intertemporal choice, each indifference curve shows the combinations of
present and future consumption that provide a certain level of utility.
The general shapes of the indifference curves---downward sloping,
steeper on the left and flatter on the right---also remain the same.

**A Labor-Leisure Example**

Petunia is working at a job that pays \$12 per hour but she gets a raise
to \$20 per hour. After family responsibilities and sleep, she has 80
hours per week available for work or leisure. As shown in [Figure
B5](#fig-append_b_5), the highest level of utility for Petunia, on her
original budget constraint, is at choice A, where it is tangent to the
lower indifference curve (Ul). Point A has 30 hours of leisure and thus
50 hours per week of work, with income of \$600 per week (that is, 50
hours of work at \$12 per hour). Petunia then gets a raise to \$20 per
hour, which shifts her budget constraint to the right. Her new
utility-maximizing choice occurs where the new budget constraint is
tangent to the higher indifference curve Uh. At B, Petunia has 40 hours
of leisure per week and works 40 hours, with income of \$800 per week
(that is, 40 hours of work at \$20 per hour).

![](media/b-indifference-curves_rId51.jpeg){width="3.25in" height="2.87in" #fig-append_b_5}

Figure B5 Effects of a Change in Petunia's Wage Petunia starts at choice
A, the tangency between her original budget constraint and the lower
indifference curve Ul. The wage increase shifts her budget constraint to
the right, so that she can now choose B on indifference curve Uh. The
substitution effect is the movement from A to C. In this case, the
substitution effect would lead Petunia to choose less leisure, which is
relatively more expensive, and more income, which is relatively cheaper
to earn. The income effect is the movement from C to B. The income
effect in this example leads to greater consumption of both goods.
Overall, in this example, income rises because of both substitution and
income effects. However, leisure declines because of the substitution
effect but increases because of the income effect---leading, in
Petunia's case, to an overall increase in the quantity of leisure
consumed.

Substitution and income effects provide a vocabulary for discussing how
Petunia reacts to a higher hourly wage. The dashed line serves as the
tool for separating the two effects on the graph.

The substitution effect tells how Petunia would have changed her hours
of work if her wage had risen, so that income was relatively cheaper to
earn and leisure was relatively more expensive, but if she had remained
at the same level of utility. The slope of the budget constraint in a
labor-leisure diagram is determined by the wage rate. Thus, the dashed
line is carefully inserted with the slope of the new opportunity set,
reflecting the labor-leisure tradeoff of the new wage rate, but tangent
to the original indifference curve, showing the same level of utility or
"buying power." The shift from original choice A to point C, which is
the point of tangency between the original indifference curve and the
dashed line, shows that because of the higher wage, Petunia will want to
consume less leisure and more income. The "s" arrows on the horizontal
and vertical axes of [Figure B5](#fig-append_b_5) show the
substitution effect on leisure and on income.

The income effect is that the higher wage, by shifting the labor-leisure
budget constraint to the right, makes it possible for Petunia to reach a
higher level of utility. The income effect is the movement from point C
to point B; that is, it shows how Petunia's behavior would change in
response to a higher level of utility or "buying power," with the wage
rate remaining the same (as shown by the dashed line being parallel to
the new budget constraint). The income effect, encouraging Petunia to
consume both more leisure and more income, is drawn with arrows on the
horizontal and vertical axis of [Figure B5](#fig-append_b_5).

Putting these effects together, Petunia responds to the higher wage by
moving from choice A to choice B. This movement involves choosing more
income, both because the substitution effect of higher wages has made
income relatively cheaper or easier to earn, and because the income
effect of higher wages has made it possible to have more income and more
leisure. Her movement from A to B also involves choosing more leisure
because, according to Petunia's preferences, the income effect that
encourages choosing more leisure is stronger than the substitution
effect that encourages choosing less leisure.

[Figure B5](#fig-append_b_5) represents only Petunia's preferences.
Other people might make other choices. For example, a person whose
substitution and income effects on leisure exactly counterbalanced each
other might react to a higher wage with a choice like D, exactly above
the original choice A, which means taking all of the benefit of the
higher wages in the form of income while working the same number of
hours. Yet another person, whose substitution effect on leisure
outweighed the income effect, might react to a higher wage by making a
choice like F, where the response to higher wages is to work more hours
and earn much more income. To represent these different preferences, you
could easily draw the indifference curve Uh to be tangent to the new
budget constraint at D or F, rather than at B.

**An Intertemporal Choice Example**

Quentin has saved up \$10,000. He is thinking about spending some or all
of it on a vacation in the present, and then will save the rest for
another big vacation five years from now. Over those five years, he
expects to earn a total 80% rate of return. [Figure
B6](#fig-append_b_6) shows Quentin's budget constraint and his
indifference curves between present consumption and future consumption.
The highest level of utility that Quentin can achieve at his original
intertemporal budget constraint occurs at point A, where he is consuming
\$6,000, saving \$4,000 for the future, and expecting with the
accumulated interest to have \$7,200 for future consumption (that is,
\$4,000 in current financial savings plus the 80% rate of return).

However, Quentin has just realized that his expected rate of return was
unrealistically high. A more realistic expectation is that over five
years he can earn a total return of 30%. In effect, his intertemporal
budget constraint has pivoted to the left, so that his original
utility-maximizing choice is no longer available. Will Quentin react to
the lower rate of return by saving more, or less, or the same amount?
Again, the language of substitution and income effects provides a
framework for thinking about the motivations behind various choices. The
dashed line, which is a graphical tool to separate the substitution and
income effect, is carefully inserted with the same slope as the new
opportunity set, so that it reflects the changed rate of return, but it
is tangent to the original indifference curve, so that it shows no
change in utility or "buying power."

The substitution effect tells how Quentin would have altered his
consumption because the lower rate of return makes future consumption
relatively more expensive and present consumption relatively cheaper.
The movement from the original choice A to point C shows how Quentin
substitutes toward more present consumption and less future consumption
in response to the lower interest rate, with no change in utility. The
substitution arrows on the horizontal and vertical axes of [Figure
B6](#fig-append_b_6) show the direction of the substitution effect
motivation. The substitution effect suggests that, because of the lower
interest rate, Quentin should consume more in the present and less in
the future.

Quentin also has an income effect motivation. The lower rate of return
shifts the budget constraint to the left, which means that Quentin's
utility or "buying power" is reduced. The income effect (assuming normal
goods) encourages less of both present and future consumption. The
impact of the income effect on reducing present and future consumption
in this example is shown with "i" arrows on the horizontal and vertical
axis of [Figure B6](#fig-append_b_6).

![](media/b-indifference-curves_rId55.jpeg){width="3.25in" height="3.22in" #fig-append_b_6}

Figure B6 Indifference Curve and an Intertemporal Budget Constraint The
original choice is A, at the tangency between the original budget
constraint and the original indifference curve Uh. The dashed line is
drawn parallel to the new budget set, so that its slope reflects the
lower rate of return, but is tangent to the original indifference curve.
The movement from A to C is the substitution effect: in this case,
future consumption has become relatively more expensive, and present
consumption has become relatively cheaper. The income effect is the
shift from C to B; that is, the reduction in utility or "buying power"
that causes a move to a lower indifference curve Ul, but with the
relative price the same. It means less present and less future
consumption. In the move from A to B, the substitution effect on present
consumption is greater than the income effect, so the overall result is
more present consumption. Notice that the lower indifference curve could
have been drawn tangent to the lower budget constraint point D or point
F, depending on personal preferences.

Taking both effects together, the substitution effect is encouraging
Quentin toward more present and less future consumption, because present
consumption is relatively cheaper, while the income effect is
encouraging him to less present and less future consumption, because the
lower interest rate is pushing him to a lower level of utility. For
Quentin's personal preferences, the substitution effect is stronger so
that, overall, he reacts to the lower rate of return with more present
consumption and less savings at choice B. However, other people might
have different preferences. They might react to a lower rate of return
by choosing the same level of present consumption and savings at choice
D, or by choosing less present consumption and more savings at a point
like F. For these other sets of preferences, the income effect of a
lower rate of return on present consumption would be relatively
stronger, while the substitution effect would be relatively weaker.

## Sketching Substitution and Income Effects

Indifference curves provide an analytical tool for looking at all the
choices that provide a single level of utility. They eliminate any need
for placing numerical values on utility and help to illuminate the
process of making utility-maximizing decisions. They also provide the
basis for a more detailed investigation of the complementary motivations
that arise in response to a change in a price, wage or rate of
return---namely, the substitution and income effects.

If you are finding it a little tricky to sketch diagrams that show
substitution and income effects so that the points of tangency all come
out correctly, it may be useful to follow this procedure.

Step 1. Begin with a budget constraint showing the choice between two
goods, which this example will call "candy" and "movies." Choose a point
A which will be the optimal choice, where the indifference curve will be
tangent---but it is often easier not to draw in the indifference curve
just yet. See [Figure B7](#fig-append_b_7).

Step 2. Now the price of movies changes: let's say that it rises. That
shifts the budget set inward. You know that the higher price will push
the decision-maker down to a lower level of utility, represented by a
lower indifference curve. But at this stage, draw only the new budget
set. See [Figure B8](#fig-append_b_8).

Step 3. The key tool in distinguishing between substitution and income
effects is to insert a dashed line, parallel to the new budget line.
This line is a graphical tool that allows you to distinguish between the
two changes: (1) the effect on consumption of the two goods of the shift
in prices---with the level of utility remaining unchanged---which is the
substitution effect; and (2) the effect on consumption of the two goods
of shifting from one indifference curve to the other---with relative
prices staying unchanged---which is the income effect. The dashed line
is inserted in this step. The trick is to have the dashed line travel
close to the original choice A, but not directly through point A. See
[Figure B9](#fig-append_b_9).

Step 4. Now, draw the original indifference curve, so that it is tangent
to both point A on the original budget line and to a point C on the
dashed line. Many students find it easiest to first select the tangency
point C where the original indifference curve touches the dashed line,
and then to draw the original indifference curve through A and C. The
substitution effect is illustrated by the movement along the original
indifference curve as prices change but the level of utility holds
constant, from A to C. As expected, the substitution effect leads to
less consumed of the good that is relatively more expensive, as shown by
the "s" (substitution) arrow on the vertical axis, and more consumed of
the good that is relatively less expensive, as shown by the "s" arrow on
the horizontal axis. See [Figure B10](#CNX_Econ_A06_011).

Step 5. With the substitution effect in place, now choose
utility-maximizing point B on the new opportunity set. When you choose
point B, think about whether you wish the substitution or the income
effect to have a larger impact on the good (in this case, candy) on the
horizontal axis. If you choose point B to be directly in a vertical line
with point A (as is illustrated here), then the income effect will be
exactly offsetting the substitution effect on the horizontal axis. If
you insert point B so that it lies a little to right of the original
point A, then the substitution effect will exceed the income effect. If
you insert point B so that it lies a little to the left of point A, then
the income effect will exceed the substitution effect. The income effect
is the movement from C to B, showing how choices shifted as a result of
the decline in buying power and the movement between two levels of
utility, with relative prices remaining the same. With normal goods, the
negative income effect means less consumed of each good, as shown by the
direction of the "i" (income effect) arrows on the vertical and
horizontal axes. See [Figure B11](#fig-append_b_11).

Figure B11

In sketching substitution and income effect diagrams, you may wish to
practice some of the following variations: (1) Price falls instead of a
rising; (2) The price change affects the good on either the vertical or
the horizontal axis; (3) Sketch these diagrams so that the substitution
effect exceeds the income effect; the income effect exceeds the
substitution effect; and the two effects are equal.

One final note: The helpful dashed line can be drawn tangent to the new
indifference curve, and parallel to the original budget line, rather
than tangent to the original indifference curve and parallel to the new
budget line. Some students find this approach more intuitively clear.
The answers you get about the direction and relative sizes of the
substitution and income effects, however, should be the same.

## Key Concepts and Summary

An indifference curve is drawn on a budget constraint diagram that shows
the tradeoffs between two goods. All points along a single indifference
curve provide the same level of utility. Higher indifference curves
represent higher levels of utility. Indifference curves slope downward
because, if utility is to remain the same at all points along the curve,
a reduction in the quantity of the good on the vertical axis must be
counterbalanced by an increase in the quantity of the good on the
horizontal axis (or vice versa). Indifference curves are steeper on the
far left and flatter on the far right, because of diminishing marginal
utility.

The utility-maximizing choice along a budget constraint will be the
point of tangency where the budget constraint touches an indifference
curve at a single point. A change in the price of any good has two
effects: a substitution effect and an income effect. The substitution
effect motivation encourages a utility-maximizer to buy less of what is
relatively more expensive and more of what is relatively cheaper. The
income effect motivation encourages a utility-maximizer to buy more of
both goods if utility rises or less of both goods if utility falls (if
they are both normal goods).

In a labor-leisure choice, every wage change has a substitution and an
income effect. The substitution effect of a wage increase is to choose
more income, since it is cheaper to earn, and less leisure, since its
opportunity cost has increased. The income effect of a wage increase is
to choose more of leisure and income, since they are both normal goods.
The substitution and income effects of a wage decrease would reverse
these directions.

In an intertemporal consumption choice, every interest rate change has a
substitution and an income effect. The substitution effect of an
interest rate increase is to choose more future consumption, since it is
now cheaper to earn future consumption and less present consumption
(more savings), since the opportunity cost of present consumption in
terms of what is being given up in the future has increased. The income
effect of an interest rate increase is to choose more of both present
and future consumption, since they are both normal goods. The
substitution and income effects of an interest rate decrease would
reverse these directions.
