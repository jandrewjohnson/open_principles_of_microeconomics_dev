## 5.1 Price Elasticity of Demand and Price Elasticity of Supply

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

-   Calculate the price elasticity of demand
-   Calculate the price elasticity of supply

Both the demand and supply curve show the relationship between price and
the number of units demanded or supplied. Price elasticity is the ratio
between the percentage change in the quantity demanded (Qd) or supplied
(Qs) and the corresponding percent change in price. The price elasticity
of demand is the percentage change in the quantity *demanded* of a good
or service divided by the percentage change in the price. The price
elasticity of supply is the percentage change in quantity *supplied*
divided by the percentage change in price.

We can usefully divide elasticities into three broad categories:
elastic, inelastic, and unitary. Because price and quantity demanded
move in opposite directions, price elasticity of demand is always a
negative number. Therefore, price elasticity of demand is usually
reported as its absolute value, without a negative sign. The summary in
[Table 5.1](#Table_05_01) is assuming absolute values for price
elasticity of demand. An elastic demand or elastic supply is one in
which the elasticity is greater than one, indicating a high
responsiveness to changes in price. Elasticities that are less than one
indicate low responsiveness to price changes and correspond to inelastic
demand or inelastic supply. Unitary elasticities indicate proportional
responsiveness of either demand or supply, as [Table 5.1](#Table_05_01)
summarizes.

To calculate elasticity along a demand or supply curve economists use
the average percent change in both quantity and price. This is called
the Midpoint Method for Elasticity, and is represented in the following
equations:

$$
\begin{array}{r}
\% \text { change in quantity }=\frac{\mathrm{Q}_2-\mathrm{Q}_1}{\left(\mathrm{Q}_2+\mathrm{Q}_1\right) / 2} \times 100 \\
\% \text { change in price }=\frac{\mathrm{P}_2-\mathrm{P}_1}{\left(\mathrm{P}_2+\mathrm{P}_1\right) / 2} \times 100
\end{array}
$$

The advantage of the Midpoint Method is that one obtains the same
elasticity between two price points whether there is a price increase or
decrease. This is because the formula uses the same base (average
quantity and average price) for both cases.

### Calculating Price Elasticity of Demand

Let's calculate the elasticity between points A and B and between points
G and H as [Figure 5.2](#CNX_Econ_C05_003) shows.

Figure 5.2 Calculating the Price Elasticity of Demand We calculate the
price elasticity of demand as the percentage change in quantity divided
by the percentage change in price.

First, apply the formula to calculate the elasticity as price decreases
from \$70 at point B to \$60 at point A:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\% \text { change in quantity } & =\frac{3,000-2,800}{(3,000+2,800) / 2} \times 100 \\
& =\frac{200}{2,900} \times 100 \\
& =6.9 \\
\% \text { change in price } & =\frac{60-70}{(60+70) / 2} \times 100 \\
& =\frac{-10}{65} \times 100 \\
& =-15.4 \\
\text { Price Elasticity of Demand } & =\frac{6.9 \%}{-15.4 \%} \\
& =0.45
\end{aligned}
$$

Therefore, the elasticity of demand between these two points is
$\frac{\ \ \ \ 6.9\%}{â€“15.4\%}$ which is 0.45, an amount smaller than
one, showing that the demand is inelastic in this interval. Price
elasticities of demand are *always* negative since price and quantity
demanded always move in opposite directions (on the demand curve). By
convention, we always talk about elasticities as positive numbers.
Mathematically, we take the absolute value of the result. We will ignore
this detail from now on, while remembering to interpret elasticities as
positive numbers.

This means that, along the demand curve between point B and A, if the
price changes by 1%, the quantity demanded will change by 0.45%. A
change in the price will result in a smaller percentage change in the
quantity demanded. For example, a 10% *increase* in the price will
result in only a 4.5% *decrease* in quantity demanded. A 10% *decrease*
in the price will result in only a 4.5% *increase* in the quantity
demanded. Price elasticities of demand are negative numbers indicating
that the demand curve is downward sloping, but we read them as absolute
values. The following Work It Out feature will walk you through
calculating the price elasticity of demand.

### Work It Out {#work-it-out .Heading3Grey}

#### Finding the Price Elasticity of Demand {#finding-the-price-elasticity-of-demand .Heading4Grey}

Calculate the price elasticity of demand using the data in [Figure
5.2](#CNX_Econ_C05_003) for an increase in price from G to H. Has the
elasticity increased or decreased?

Step 1. We know that:

$$
\text { Price Elasticity of Demand }=\frac{\% \text { change in quantity }}{\% \text { change in price }}
$$

Step 2. From the Midpoint Formula we know that:

$$
\begin{array}{r}
\% \text { change in quantity }=\frac{\mathrm{Q}_2-\mathrm{Q}_1}{\left(\mathrm{Q}_2+\mathrm{Q}_1\right) / 2} \times 100 \\
\% \text { change in price }=\frac{\mathrm{P}_2-\mathrm{P}_1}{\left(\mathrm{P}_2+\mathrm{P}_1\right) / 2} \times 100
\end{array}
$$

Step 3. So we can use the values provided in the figure in each
equation:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \% \text { change in quantity }=\frac{1,600-1,800}{(1,600+1,800) / 2} \times 100 \\
& =\frac{-200}{1,700} \times 100 \\
& =-11.76 \\
& \% \text { change in price }=\frac{130-120}{(130+120) / 2} \times 100 \\
& =\frac{10}{125} \times 100 \\
& =8.0 \\
&
\end{aligned}
$$

Step 4. Then, we can use those values to determine the price elasticity
of demand:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { Price Elasticity of Demand } & =\frac{\% \text { change in quantity }}{\% \text { change in price }} \\
& =\frac{-11.76}{8} \\
& =1.47
\end{aligned}
$$

Therefore, the elasticity of demand from G to is H 1.47. The magnitude
of the elasticity has increased (in absolute value) as we moved up along
the demand curve from points A to B. Recall that the elasticity between
these two points was 0.45. Demand was inelastic between points A and B
and elastic between points G and H. This shows us that price elasticity
of demand changes at different points along a straight-line demand
curve.

### Calculating the Price Elasticity of Supply

Assume that an apartment rents for \$650 per month and at that price the
landlord rents 10,000 units as [Figure 5.3](#CNX_Econ_C05_023) shows.
When the price increases to \$700 per month, the landlord supplies
13,000 units into the market. By what percentage does apartment supply
increase? What is the price sensitivity?

![](media/5-1-price-elasticity-of-demand-and-price-elasticity-of-supply_rId54.jpeg){width="3.25in" height="2.635in"}

Figure 5.3 Price Elasticity of Supply We calculate the price elasticity
of supply as the percentage change in quantity divided by the percentage
change in price.

Using the Midpoint Method,

$$
\begin{aligned}
\% \text { change in quantity } & =\frac{13,000-10,000}{(13,000+10,000) / 2} \times 100 \\
& =\frac{3,000}{11,500} \times 100 \\
& =26.1 \\
\% \text { change in price } & =\frac{\$ 700-\$ 650}{(\$ 700+\$ 650) / 2} \times 100 \\
& =\frac{50}{675} \times 100 \\
& =7.4 \\
\text { Price Elasticity of Supply } & =\frac{26.1 \%}{7.4 \%} \\
& =3.53
\end{aligned}
$$

Again, as with the elasticity of demand, the elasticity of supply is not
followed by any units. Elasticity is a ratio of one percentage change to
another percentage change---nothing more---and we read it as an absolute
value. In this case, a 1% rise in price causes an increase in quantity
supplied of 3.5%. The greater than one elasticity of supply means that
the percentage change in quantity supplied will be greater than a one
percent price change. If you\'re starting to wonder if the concept of
slope fits into this calculation, read the following Clear It Up box.

### Clear It Up {#clear-it-up .Heading3Grey}

#### Is the elasticity the slope? {#is-the-elasticity-the-slope .Heading4Grey}

It is a common mistake to confuse the slope of either the supply or
demand curve with its elasticity. The slope is the rate of change in
units along the curve, or the rise/run (change in y over the change in
x). For example, in [Figure 5.2](#CNX_Econ_C05_003), at each point shown
on the demand curve, price drops by \$10 and the number of units
demanded increases by 200 compared to the point to its left. The slope
is --10/200 along the entire demand curve and does not change. The price
elasticity, however, changes along the curve. Elasticity between points
A and B was 0.45 and increased to 1.47 between points G and H.
Elasticity is the *percentage* change, which is a different calculation
from the slope and has a different meaning.

When we are at the upper end of a demand curve, where price is high and
the quantity demanded is low, a small change in the quantity demanded,
even in, say, one unit, is pretty big in percentage terms. A change in
price of, say, a dollar, is going to be much less important in
percentage terms than it would have been at the bottom of the demand
curve. Likewise, at the bottom of the demand curve, that one unit change
when the quantity demanded is high will be small as a percentage.

Thus, at one end of the demand curve, where we have a large percentage
change in quantity demanded over a small percentage change in price, the
elasticity value would be high, or demand would be relatively elastic.
Even with the same change in the price and the same change in the
quantity demanded, at the other end of the demand curve the quantity is
much higher, and the price is much lower, so the percentage change in
quantity demanded is smaller and the percentage change in price is much
higher. That means at the bottom of the curve we\'d have a small
numerator over a large denominator, so the elasticity measure would be
much lower, or inelastic.

As we move along the demand curve, the values for quantity and price go
up or down, depending on which way we are moving, so the percentages
for, say, a \$1 difference in price or a one unit difference in
quantity, will change as well, which means the ratios of those
percentages and hence the elasticity will change.
