### Introduction to Production, Costs, and Industry Structure

#### Bring It Home {#bring-it-home .Heading3Grey}

##### Amazon {#amazon .Heading4Grey}

In less than two decades, Amazon.com has transformed the way consumers
sell, buy, and even read. Prior to Amazon, independent bookstores with
limited inventories in small retail locations primarily sold books.
There were exceptions, of course. Borders and Barnes & Noble offered
larger stores in urban areas. In the last decade, however, independent
bookstores have mostly disappeared, Borders has gone out of business,
and Barnes & Noble is struggling. Online delivery and purchase of books
has overtaken the more traditional business models. How has Amazon
changed the book selling industry? How has it managed to crush its
competition?

A major reason for the giant retailer's success is its production model
and cost structure, which has enabled Amazon to undercut the
competitors\' prices even when factoring in the cost of shipping. Read
on to see how firms great (like Amazon) and small (like your corner
deli) determine what to sell, at what output, and price.

This chapter is the first of four chapters that explores the *theory of
the firm*. This theory explains how firms behave. What does that mean?
Let's define what we mean by the firm. A firm (or producer or business)
combines inputs of labor, capital, land, and raw or finished component
materials to produce outputs. If the firm is successful, the outputs are
more valuable than the inputs. This activity of production goes beyond
manufacturing (i.e., making things). It includes any process or service
that creates value, including transportation, distribution, wholesale
and retail sales.

Production involves a number of important decisions that define a
firm\'s behavior. These decisions include, but are not limited to:

-   What product or products should the firm produce?
-   How should the firm produce the products (i.e., what production
    process should the firm use)?
-   How much output should the firm produce?
-   What price should the firm charge for its products?
-   How much labor should the firm employ?

The answers to these questions depend on the production and cost
conditions facing each firm. That is the subject of this chapter. The
answers also depend on the market structure for the product(s) in
question. Market structure is a multidimensional concept that involves
how competitive the industry is. We define it by questions such as
these:

-   How much market power does each firm in the industry possess?
-   How similar is each firm's product to the products of other firms in
    the industry?
-   How difficult is it for new firms to enter the industry?
-   Do firms compete on the basis of price, advertising, or other
    product differences?

[Figure 7.2](#fig-7_2) illustrates the range of different
market structures, which we will explore in @sec-chapter-8,
@sec-chapter-9,
and @sec-chapter-10.

Figure 7.2 The Spectrum of Competition Firms face different competitive
situations. At one extreme---perfect competition---many firms are all
trying to sell identical products. At the other
extreme---monopoly---only one firm is selling the product, and this firm
faces no competition. Monopolistic competition and oligopoly fall
between the extremes of perfect competition and monopoly. Monopolistic
competition is a situation with many firms selling similar, but not
identical products. Oligopoly is a situation with few firms that sell
identical or similar products.

Let\'s examine how firms determine their costs and desired profit
levels. Then we will discuss the origins of cost, both in the short and
long run. Private enterprise, which can be private individual or group
business ownership, characterizes the U.S. economy. In the U.S. system,
we have the option to organize private businesses as sole
proprietorships (one owner), partners (more than one owner), and
corporations (legal entitles separate from the owners.

When people think of businesses, often corporate giants like Wal-Mart,
Microsoft, or General Motors come to mind. However, firms come in all
sizes, as @tbl-table_7_1 shows. The vast majority of American
firms have fewer than 20 employees. As of 2010, the U.S. Census Bureau
counted 5.7 million firms with employees in the U.S. economy. Slightly
less than half of all the workers in private firms are at the 17,000
large firms, meaning they employ more than 500 workers. Another 35% of
workers in the U.S. economy are at firms with fewer than 100 workers.
These small-scale businesses include everything from dentists and
lawyers to businesses that mow lawns or clean houses. @tbl-table_7_1 does not include a separate category for the millions
of small "non-employer" businesses where a single owner or a few
partners are not officially paid wages or a salary, but simply receive
whatever they can earn.

| Number of Employees | Firms (% of total firms) | Number of Paid Employees (% of total employment) |
|----------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Total**            | **5,734,538**            | **112.0 million**                             |

### 7.1 Explicit and Implicit Costs, and Accounting and Economic Profit

#### Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

-   Explain the difference between explicit costs and implicit costs
-   Understand the relationship between cost and revenue

Each business, regardless of size or complexity, tries to earn a profit:

$\text{Profit} = \text{Total~Revenue\ –\ Total~Cost}$

Total revenue is the income the firm generates from selling its
products. We calculate it by multiplying the price of the product times
the quantity of output sold:

$\text{Total~Revenue} = \text{Price\ ×\ Quantity}$

We will see in the following chapters that revenue is a function of the
demand for the firm's products.

Total cost is what the firm pays for producing and selling its products.
Recall that production involves the firm converting inputs to outputs.
Each of those inputs has a cost to the firm. The sum of all those costs
is total cost. We will learn in this chapter that short run costs are
different from long run costs.

We can distinguish between two types of cost: explicit and implicit.
Explicit costs are out-of-pocket costs, that is, actual payments. Wages
that a firm pays its employees or rent that a firm pays for its office
are explicit costs. Implicit costs are more subtle, but just as
important. They represent the opportunity cost of using resources that
the firm already owns. Often for small businesses, they are resources
that the owners contribute. For example, working in the business while
not earning a formal salary, or using the ground floor of a home as a
retail store are both implicit costs. Implicit costs also include the
depreciation of goods, materials, and equipment that are necessary for a
company to operate. (See the Work It Out feature for an extended
example.)

These two definitions of cost are important for distinguishing between
two conceptions of profit, accounting profit, and economic profit.
Accounting profit is a cash concept. It means total revenue minus
explicit costs---the difference between dollars brought in and dollars
paid out. Economic profit is total revenue minus total cost, including
both explicit and implicit costs. The difference is important because
even though a business pays income taxes based on its accounting profit,
whether or not it is economically successful depends on its economic
profit.

#### Work It Out {#work-it-out .Heading3Grey}

##### Calculating Implicit Costs {#calculating-implicit-costs .Heading4Grey}

Consider the following example. Eryn currently works for a corporate law
firm. She is considering opening her own legal practice, where she
expects to earn \$200,000 per year once she establishes herself. To run
her own firm, she would need an office and a law clerk. She has found
the perfect office, which rents for \$50,000 per year. She could hire a
law clerk for \$35,000 per year. If these figures are accurate, would
Eryn's legal practice be profitable?

Step 1. First you have to calculate the costs. You can take what you
know about explicit costs and total them:

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
\text { Office rental : } & \$ 50,000 \\
\text { Law clerk's salary : } & +\$ 35,000 \\
\hline \text { Total explicit costs : } & \$ 85,000
\end{array}
$$

Step 2. Subtracting the explicit costs from the revenue gives you the
accounting profit.

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
\text { Revenues : } & \$ 200,000 \\
\text { Explicit costs : } & -\$ 85,000 \\
\hline \text { Accounting profit : } & \$ 115,000
\end{array}
$$

However, these calculations consider only the explicit costs. To open
her own practice, Eryn would have to quit her current job, where she is
earning an annual salary of \$125,000. This would be an implicit cost of
opening her own firm.

Step 3. You need to subtract both the explicit and implicit costs to
determine the true economic profit:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { Economic profit } & =\text { total revenues }- \text { explicit costs }- \text { implicit costs } \\
& =\$ 200,000-\$ 85,000-\$ 125,000 \\
& =-\$ 10,000 \text { per year }
\end{aligned}
$$

Eryn would be losing \$10,000 per year. That does not mean she would not
want to open her own business, but it does mean she would be earning
\$10,000 less than if she worked for the corporate firm.

Implicit costs can include other things as well. Maybe Eryn values her
leisure time, and starting her own firm would require her to put in more
hours than at the corporate firm. In this case, the lost leisure would
also be an implicit cost that would subtract from economic profits.

Now that we have an idea about the different types of costs, let's look
at cost structures. A firm's cost structure in the long run may be
different from that in the short run. We turn to that distinction in the
next few sections.


### 7.2 Production in the Short Run

#### Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

-   Understand the concept of a production function
-   Differentiate between the different types of inputs or factors in a
    production function
-   Differentiate between fixed and variable inputs
-   Differentiate between production in the short run and in the long
    run
-   Differentiate between total and marginal product
-   Understand the concept of diminishing marginal productivity

In this chapter, we want to explore the relationship between the
quantity of output a firm produces, and the cost of producing that
output. We mentioned that the cost of the product depends on how many
inputs are required to produce the product and what those inputs cost.
We can answer the former question by looking at the firm's production
function.

![](media/7-2-production-in-the-short-run_rId22.jpeg){width="6.5in" height="4.335in" #fig-7_3}

Figure 7.3 The production process for pizza includes inputs such as
ingredients, the efforts of the pizza maker, and tools and materials for
cooking and serving. (Credit: "Grilled gluten-free BBQ chicken pizza" by
Keith McDuffee/Flickr, CC BY 2.0)

Production is the process (or processes) a firm uses to transform inputs
(e.g., labor, capital, raw materials) into outputs, i.e. the goods or
services the firm wishes to sell. Consider pizza making. The pizzaiolo
(pizza maker) takes flour, water, and yeast to make dough. Similarly,
the pizzaiolo may take tomatoes, spices, and water to make pizza sauce.
The cook rolls out the dough, brushes on the pizza sauce, and adds
cheese and other toppings. The pizzaiolo uses a peel---the shovel-like
wooden tool---to put the pizza into the oven to cook. Once baked, the
pizza goes into a box (if it's for takeout) and the customer pays for
the good. What are the inputs (or factors of production) in the
production process for this pizza?

Economists divide factors of production into several categories:

-   Natural Resources (Land and Raw Materials) - The ingredients for the
    pizza are raw materials. These include the flour, yeast, and water
    for the dough, the tomatoes, herbs, and water for the sauce, the
    cheese, and the toppings. If the pizza place uses a wood-burning
    oven, we would include the wood as a raw material. If the
    establishment heats the oven with natural gas, we would count this
    as a raw material. Don't forget electricity for lights. If, instead
    of pizza, we were looking at an agricultural product, like wheat, we
    would include the land the farmer used for crops here.
-   Labor -- When we talk about production, labor means human effort,
    both physical and mental. The pizzaiolo was the primary example of
    labor here. They need to be strong enough to roll out the dough and
    to insert and retrieve the pizza from the oven, but they also must
    know **how** to make the pizza, how long it cooks in the oven and a
    myriad of other aspects of pizza-making. The business may also have
    one or more people to work the counter, take orders, and receive
    payment.
-   Capital -- When economists uses the term capital, they do not mean
    financial capital (money); rather, they mean physical capital, the
    machines, equipment, and buildings that one uses to produce the
    product. In the case of pizza, the capital includes the peel, the
    oven, the building, and any other necessary equipment (for example,
    tables and chairs).
-   Technology -- Technology refers to the process or processes for
    producing the product. How does the pizzaiolo combine ingredients to
    make pizza? How hot should the oven be? How long should the pizza
    cook? What is the best oven to use? Gas or wood burning? Should the
    restaurant make its own dough, sauce, cheese, toppings, or should it
    buy them?
-   Entrepreneurship -- Production involves many decisions and much
    knowledge, even for something as simple as pizza. Who makes those
    decisions? Ultimately, it is the entrepreneur, the person who
    creates the business, whose idea it is to combine the inputs to
    produce the outputs.

The cost of producing pizza (or any output) depends on the amount of
labor capital, raw materials, and other inputs required and the price of
each input to the entrepreneur. Let's explore these ideas in more
detail.

We can summarize the ideas so far in terms of a production function, a
mathematical expression or equation that explains the engineering
relationship between inputs and outputs:

$Q = f\left\lbrack NR\text{,}\ L\text{,}\ K\text{,}\ t\text{,}\ E \right\rbrack$

The production function gives the answer to the question, how much
output can the firm produce given different amounts of inputs?
Production functions are specific to the product. Different products
have different production functions. The amount of labor a farmer uses
to produce a bushel of wheat is likely different than that required to
produce an automobile. Firms in the same industry may have somewhat
different production functions, since each firm may produce a little
differently. One pizza restaurant may make its own dough and sauce,
while another may buy those pre-made. A sit-down pizza restaurant
probably uses more labor (to handle table service) than a purely
take-out restaurant.

We can describe inputs as either fixed or variable.

Fixed inputs are those that can't easily be increased or decreased in a
short period of time. In the pizza example, the building is a fixed
input. The restaurant owner signs a lease and is stuck in the building
until the lease expires. Fixed inputs define the firm's maximum output
capacity. This is analogous to the potential real GDP shown by society's
production possibilities curve, i.e., the maximum quantities of outputs
a society can produce at a given time with its available resources.

Variable inputs are those that can easily be increased or decreased in a
short period of time. The pizzaiolo can order more ingredients with a
phone call, so ingredients would be variable inputs. The owner could
hire a new person to work the counter pretty quickly as well.

Economists often use a short-hand form for the production function:

$Q = f\left\lbrack L\text{,}\ K \right\rbrack\text{,}$

where L represents all the variable inputs, and K represents all the
fixed inputs.

Economists differentiate between short and long run production.

The short run is the period of time during which at least some factors
of production are fixed. During the period of the pizza restaurant
lease, the pizza restaurant is operating in the short run, because it is
limited to using the current building---the owner can't choose a larger
or smaller building.

The long run is the period of time during which all factors are
variable. Once the lease expires for the pizza restaurant, the shop
owner can move to a larger or smaller place.

Let's explore production in the short run using a specific example: tree
cutting (for lumber) with a two-person crosscut saw.

![](media/7-2-production-in-the-short-run_rId38.jpeg){width="6.5in" height="3.685in" #fig-7_4}

Figure 7.4 Production in the short run may be explored through the
example of lumberjacks using a two-person saw. (Credit: "DO - Apple Day
Civilian Conservation Corps Demonstration Crosscut Saw (Gladden)" by
Virginia State Parks/Flickr, CC BY 2.0)

Since by definition capital is fixed in the short run, our production
function becomes

$Q = f\lbrack L\text{,}\ \overset{-}{K}\rbrack\ \text{or}\ Q = f\lbrack L\rbrack$

This equation simply indicates that since capital is fixed, the amount
of output (e.g., trees cut down per day) depends only on the amount of
labor employed (e.g., number of lumberjacks working). We can express
this production function numerically as @tbl-table_7_2 below
shows.

| #Lumberjacks | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|--------------|---|---|---|---|---|
| #Trees (TP)  | 4 | 10 | 12 | 13 | 13 |
| MP           | 4 | 6 | 2 | 1 | 0 |

: Short Run Production Function for Trees {#tbl-table_7_2}

Note that we have introduced some new language. We also call Output (Q)
Total Product (TP), which means the amount of output produced with a
given amount of labor and a fixed amount of capital. In this example,
one lumberjack using a two-person saw can cut down four trees in an
hour. Two lumberjacks using a two-person saw can cut down ten trees in
an hour.

We should also introduce a critical concept: marginal product. Marginal
product is the additional output of one more worker. Mathematically,
Marginal Product is the change in total product divided by the change in
labor: $MP = \Delta TP/\Delta L$. In the table above, since 0 workers
produce 0 trees, the marginal product of the first worker is four trees
per day, but the marginal product of the second worker is six trees per
day. Why might that be the case? It's because of the nature of the
capital the workers are using. A two-person saw works much better with
two persons than with one. Suppose we add a third lumberjack to the
story. What will that person's marginal product be? What will that
person contribute to the team? Perhaps they can oil the saw\'s teeth to
keep it sawing smoothly or they could bring water to the two people
sawing. What you see in the table is a critically important conclusion
about production in the short run: It may be that as we add workers, the
marginal product increases at first, but sooner or later additional
workers will have decreasing marginal product. In fact, there may
eventually be no effect or a negative effect on output. This is called
the Law of Diminishing Marginal Product and it's a characteristic of
production in the short run. Diminishing marginal productivity is very
similar to the concept of diminishing marginal utility that we learned
about in the chapter on consumer choice. Both concepts are examples of
the more general concept of diminishing marginal returns. Why does
diminishing marginal productivity occur? It's because of fixed capital.
We will see this more clearly when we discuss production in the long
run.

We can show these concepts graphically as [Figure
7.5](#fig-7_5) and [Figure 7.6](#fig-7_6)
illustrate. [Figure 7.5](#fig-7_5) graphically shows the data
from @tbl-table_7_2. [Figure 7.6](#fig-7_6) shows the
more general cases of total product and marginal product curves.

### 7.3 Costs in the Short Run

#### Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

-   Understand the relationship between production and costs
-   Understand that every factor of production has a corresponding
    factor price
-   Analyze short-run costs in terms of total cost, fixed cost, variable
    cost, marginal cost, and average cost
-   Calculate average profit
-   Evaluate patterns of costs to determine potential profit

We've explained that a firm's total costs depend on the quantities of
inputs the firm uses to produce its output and the cost of those inputs
to the firm. The firm's production function tells us how much output the
firm will produce with given amounts of inputs. However, if we think
about that backwards, it tells us how many inputs the firm needs to
produce a given quantity of output, which is the first thing we need to
determine total cost. Let's move to the second factor we need to
determine.

For every factor of production (or input), there is an associated factor
payment. Factor payments are what the firm pays for the use of the
factors of production. From the firm's perspective, factor payments are
costs. From the owner of each factor's perspective, factor payments are
income. Factor payments include:

-   Raw materials prices for raw materials
-   Rent for land or buildings
-   Wages and salaries for labor
-   Interest and dividends for the use of financial capital (loans and
    equity investments)
-   Profit for entrepreneurship. Profit is the residual, what's left
    over from revenues after the firm pays all the other costs. While it
    may seem odd to treat profit as a "cost", it is what entrepreneurs
    earn for taking the risk of starting a business. You can see this
    correspondence between factors of production and factor payments in
    the inside loop of the circular flow diagram in [Figure
    1.7](#fig-1_7).

We now have all the information necessary to determine a firm's costs.

A cost function is a mathematical expression or equation that shows the
cost of producing different levels of output.

| Q    | 1     | 2    | 3    | 4    |
|------|-------|------|------|------|
| Cost | $32.50 | $44  | $52  | $90  |

: Cost Function for Producing Widgets {#tbl-table_7_3}

What we observe is that the cost increases as the firm produces higher
quantities of output. This is pretty intuitive, since producing more
output requires greater quantities of inputs, which cost more dollars to
acquire.

What is the origin of these cost figures? They come from the production
function and the factor payments. The discussion of costs in the short
run above, [Costs in the Short
Run](#Xa39a3ee5e6b4b0d3255bfef95601890afd80709), was based on the
following production function, which is similar to @tbl-table_7_3
except for \"widgets\" instead of trees.

| Workers (L)     | 1    | 2    | 3    | 3.25 | 4.4  | 5.2  | 6    | 7    | 8    | 9    |
|-----------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|
| **Widgets (Q)** | 0.2  | 0.4  | 0.8  | 1    | 2    | 3    | 3.5  | 3.8  | 3.95 | 4    |

: Production Function for Widgets {#tbl-table_7_4}

We can use the information from the production function to determine
production costs. What we need to know is how many workers are required
to produce any quantity of output. If we flip the order of the rows, we
"invert" the production function so it shows $L = f(Q)$.

| Widgets (Q)     | 0.2  | 0.4  | 0.8  | 1    | 2    | 3    | 3.5  | 3.8  | 3.95 | 4    |
|-----------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|
| **Workers (L)** | 1    | 2    | 3    | 3.25 | 4.4  | 5.2  | 6    | 7    | 8    | 9    |

: Inverted Production Function for Widgets {#tbl-table_7_5}

Now focus on the whole number quantities of output. We'll eliminate the
fractions from the table:

| Widgets (Q)     | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   |
|-----------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| **Workers (L)** | 3.25| 4.4 | 5.2 | 9   |

: Inverted Production Function for Widgets {#tbl-table_7_6}

Suppose widget workers receive \$10 per hour. Multiplying the Workers
row by \$10 (and eliminating the blanks) gives us the cost of producing
different levels of output.

| Widgets (Q)     | 1.00 | 2.00 | 3.00 | 4.00 |
|-----------------|------|------|------|------|
| **Workers (L)** | 3.25 | 4.4  | 5.2  | 9    |
| **× Wage Rate per hour** | $10 | $10 | $10 | $10 |
| **= Cost** | $32.50 | $44.00 | $52.00 | $90.00 |

: Cost Function for Producing Widgets {#tbl-table_7_7}

This is same cost function with which we began! (shown in @tbl-table_7_3)

Now that we have the basic idea of the cost origins and how they are
related to production, let's drill down into the details.

#### Average and Marginal Costs

The cost of producing a firm's output depends on how much labor and
physical capital the firm uses. A list of the costs involved in
producing cars will look very different from the costs involved in
producing computer software or haircuts or fast-food meals.

We can measure costs in a variety of ways. Each way provides its own
insight into costs. Sometimes firms need to look at their cost per unit
of output, not just their total cost. There are two ways to measure per
unit costs. The most intuitive way is average cost. Average cost is the
cost on average of producing a given quantity. We define average cost as
total cost divided by the quantity of output produced. $AC = TC/Q$ If
producing two widgets costs a total of \$44, the average cost per widget
is $\$ 44/2 = \$ 22$ per widget. The other way of measuring cost per
unit is marginal cost. If average cost is the cost of the average unit
of output produced, marginal cost is the cost of each individual unit
produced. More formally, marginal cost is the cost of producing one more
unit of output. Mathematically, marginal cost is the change in total
cost divided by the change in output: $MC = \Delta TC/\Delta Q$. If the
cost of the first widget is \$32.50 and the cost of two widgets is \$44,
the marginal cost of the second widget is $\$ 44 - \$ 32.50 = \$ 11.50.$
We can see the Widget Cost table redrawn below with average and marginal
cost added.

| Q             | 1     | 2     | 3     | 4     |
|---------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| Total Cost    | $32.50 | $44.00 | $52.00 | $90.00 |
| Average Cost  | $32.50 | $22.00 | $17.33 | $22.50 |
| Marginal Cost | $32.50 | $11.50 | $8.00  | $38.00 |

Note that the marginal cost of the first unit of output is always the
same as total cost.

#### Fixed and Variable Costs

We can decompose costs into fixed and variable costs. Fixed costs are
the costs of the fixed inputs (e.g., capital). Because fixed inputs do
not change in the short run, fixed costs are expenditures that do not
change regardless of the level of production. Whether you produce a
great deal or a little, the fixed costs are the same. One example is the
rent on a factory or a retail space. Once you sign the lease, the rent
is the same regardless of how much you produce, at least until the lease
expires. Fixed costs can take many other forms: for example, the cost of
machinery or equipment to produce the product, research and development
costs to develop new products, even an expense like advertising to
popularize a brand name. The amount of fixed costs varies according to
the specific line of business: for instance, manufacturing computer
chips requires an expensive factory, but a local moving and hauling
business can get by with almost no fixed costs at all if it rents trucks
by the day when needed.

Variable costs are the costs of the variable inputs (e.g., labor). The
only way to increase or decrease output is by increasing or decreasing
the variable inputs. Therefore, variable costs increase or decrease with
output. We treat labor as a variable cost, since producing a greater
quantity of a good or service typically requires more workers or more
work hours. Variable costs would also include raw materials.

Total costs are the sum of fixed plus variable costs. Let\'s look at
another example. Consider the barber shop called "The Clip Joint" in
[Figure 7.7](#fig-7_7). The data for output and costs are in
@tbl-table_7_9. The fixed costs of operating the barber shop,
including the space and equipment, are \$160 per day. The variable costs
are the costs of hiring barbers, which in our example is \$80 per barber
each day. The first two columns of the table show the quantity of
haircuts the barbershop can produce as it hires additional barbers. The
third column shows the fixed costs, which do not change regardless of
the level of production. The fourth column shows the variable costs at
each level of output. We calculate these by taking the amount of labor
hired and multiplying by the wage. For example, two barbers cost: 2 ×
\$80 = \$160. Adding together the fixed costs in the third column and
the variable costs in the fourth column produces the total costs in the
fifth column. For example, with two barbers the total cost is: \$160 +
\$160 = \$320.

| Labor | Quantity | Fixed Cost | Variable Cost | Total Cost |
|-------|----------|------------|---------------|------------|
| 1     | 16       | $160       | $80           | $240       |
| 2     | 40       | $160       | $160          | $320       |
| 3     | 60       | $160       | $240          | $400       |
| 4     | 72       | $160       | $320          | $480       |
| 5     | 80       | $160       | $400          | $560       |
| 6     | 84       | $160       | $480          | $640       |
| 7     | 82       | $160       | $560          | $720       |

![](media/7-3-costs-in-the-short-run_rId34.jpeg){width="3.25in" height="2.185in" #fig-7_7}

Figure 7.7 How Output Affects Total Costs At zero production, the fixed
costs of \$160 are still present. As production increases, variable
costs are added to fixed costs, and the total cost is the sum of the
two.

At zero production, the fixed costs of \$160 are still present. As
production increases, we add variable costs to fixed costs, and the
total cost is the sum of the two. [Figure 7.7](#fig-7_7)
graphically shows the relationship between the quantity of output
produced and the cost of producing that output. We always show the fixed
costs as the vertical intercept of the total cost curve; that is, they
are the costs incurred when output is zero so there are no variable
costs.

You can see from the graph that once production starts, total costs and
variable costs rise. While variable costs may initially increase at a
decreasing rate, at some point they begin increasing at an increasing
rate. This is caused by diminishing marginal productivity which we
discussed earlier in @sec-chapter-7
section of this chapter, which is easiest to see with an example. As the
number of barbers increases from zero to one in the table, output
increases from 0 to 16 for a marginal gain (or marginal product) of 16.
As the number rises from one to two barbers, output increases from 16 to
40, a marginal gain of 24. From that point on, though, the marginal
product diminishes as we add each additional barber. For example, as the
number of barbers rises from two to three, the marginal product is only
20; and as the number rises from three to four, the marginal product is
only 12.

To understand the reason behind this pattern, consider that a one-man
barber shop is a very busy operation. The single barber needs to do
everything: say hello to people entering, answer the phone, cut hair,
sweep, and run the cash register. A second barber reduces the level of
disruption from jumping back and forth between these tasks, and allows a
greater division of labor and specialization. The result can be
increasing marginal productivity. However, as the shop adds other
barbers, the advantage of each additional barber is less, since the
specialization of labor can only go so far. The addition of a sixth or
seventh or eighth barber just to greet people at the door will have less
impact than the second one did. This is the pattern of diminishing
marginal productivity. As a result, the total costs of production will
begin to rise more rapidly as output increases. At some point, you may
even see negative returns as the additional barbers begin bumping elbows
and getting in each other's way. In this case, the addition of still
more barbers would actually cause output to decrease, as the last row of
@tbl-table_7_9 shows.

This pattern of diminishing marginal productivity is common in
production. As another example, consider the problem of irrigating a
crop on a farmer's field. The plot of land is the fixed factor of
production, while the water that the farmer can add to the land is the
key variable cost. As the farmer adds water to the land, output
increases. However, adding increasingly more water brings smaller
increases in output, until at some point the water floods the field and
actually reduces output. Diminishing marginal productivity occurs
because, with fixed inputs (land in this example), each additional unit
of input (e.g., water) contributes less to overall production.

#### Average Total Cost, Average Variable Cost, Marginal Cost

The breakdown of total costs into fixed and variable costs can provide a
basis for other insights as well. The first five columns of @tbl-table_7_10 duplicate the previous table, but the last three
columns show average total costs, average variable costs, and marginal
costs. These new measures analyze costs on a per-unit (rather than a
total) basis and are reflected in the curves in [Figure
7.8](#fig-7_8).

![](media/7-3-costs-in-the-short-run_rId41.jpeg){width="2.79in" height="2.29in" #fig-7_8}

Figure 7.8 Cost Curves at the Clip Joint We can also present the
information on total costs, fixed cost, and variable cost on a per-unit
basis. We calculate average total cost (ATC) by dividing total cost by
the total quantity produced. The average total cost curve is typically
U-shaped. We calculate average variable cost (AVC) by dividing variable
cost by the quantity produced. The average variable cost curve lies
below the average total cost curve and is also typically U-shaped. We
calculate marginal cost (MC) by taking the change in total cost between
two levels of output and dividing by the change in output. The marginal
cost curve is upward-sloping.

| Labor | Quantity | Fixed Cost | Variable Cost | Total Cost | Marginal Cost | Average Total Cost | Average Variable Cost |
|-------|----------|------------|---------------|------------|----------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| 1     | 16       | $160       | $80           | $240       | $15.00         | $15.00              | $5.00                  |
| 2     | 40       | $160       | $160          | $320       | $3.33          | $8.00               | $4.00                  |
| 3     | 60       | $160       | $240          | $400       | $4.00          | $6.67               | $4.00                  |
| 4     | 72       | $160       | $320          | $480       | $6.67          | $6.67               | $4.44                  |

| 6     | 84       | $160       | $480          | $640       | $20.00         | $7.62               | $5.71                  |

: Different Types of Costs {#tbl-table_7_10}

Average total cost (sometimes referred to simply as average cost) is
total cost divided by the quantity of output. Since the total cost of
producing 40 haircuts is \$320, the average total cost for producing
each of 40 haircuts is \$320/40, or \$8 per haircut. Average cost curves
are typically U-shaped, as [Figure 7.8](#fig-7_8) shows.
Average total cost starts off relatively high, because at low levels of
output total costs are dominated by the fixed cost. Mathematically, the
denominator is so small that average total cost is large. Average total
cost then declines, as the fixed costs are spread over an increasing
quantity of output. In the average cost calculation, the rise in the
numerator of total costs is relatively small compared to the rise in the
denominator of quantity produced. However, as output expands still
further, the average cost begins to rise. At the right side of the
average cost curve, total costs begin rising more rapidly as diminishing
returns come into effect.

We obtain average variable cost when we divide variable cost by quantity
of output. For example, the variable cost of producing 80 haircuts is
\$400, so the average variable cost is \$400/80, or \$5 per haircut.
Note that at any level of output, the average variable cost curve will
always lie below the curve for average total cost, as [Figure
7.8](#fig-7_8) shows. The reason is that average total cost
includes average variable cost and average fixed cost. Thus, for Q = 80
haircuts, the average total cost is \$8 per haircut, while the average
variable cost is \$5 per haircut. However, as output grows, fixed costs
become relatively less important (since they do not rise with output),
so average variable cost sneaks closer to average cost.

Average total and variable costs measure the average costs of producing
some quantity of output. Marginal cost is somewhat different. Marginal
cost is the additional cost of producing one more unit of output. It is
not the cost per unit of *all* units produced, but only the next one (or
next few). We calculate marginal cost by taking the change in total cost
and dividing it by the change in quantity. For example, as quantity
produced increases from 40 to 60 haircuts, total costs rise by 400 --
320, or 80. Thus, the marginal cost for each of those marginal 20 units
will be 80/20, or \$4 per haircut. The marginal cost curve is generally
upward-sloping, because diminishing marginal returns implies that
additional units are more costly to produce. We can see small range of
increasing marginal returns in the figure as a dip in the marginal cost
curve before it starts rising. There is a point at which marginal and
average costs meet, as the following Clear it Up feature discusses.

#### Clear It Up {#clear-it-up .Heading3Grey}

##### Where do marginal and average costs meet? {#where-do-marginal-and-average-costs-meet .Heading4Grey}

The marginal cost line intersects the average cost line exactly at the
bottom of the average cost curve---which occurs at a quantity of 72 and
cost of \$6.60 in [Figure 7.8](#fig-7_8). The reason why the
intersection occurs at this point is built into the economic meaning of
marginal and average costs. If the marginal cost of production is below
the average cost for producing previous units, as it is for the points
to the left of where MC crosses ATC, then producing one more additional
unit will reduce average costs overall---and the ATC curve will be
downward-sloping in this zone. Conversely, if the marginal cost of
production for producing an additional unit is above the average cost
for producing the earlier units, as it is for points to the right of
where MC crosses ATC, then producing a marginal unit will increase
average costs overall---and the ATC curve must be upward-sloping in this
zone. The point of transition, between where MC is pulling ATC down and
where it is pulling it up, must occur at the minimum point of the ATC
curve.

This idea of the marginal cost "pulling down" the average cost or
"pulling up" the average cost may sound abstract, but think about it in
terms of your own grades. If the score on the most recent quiz you take
is lower than your average score on previous quizzes, then the marginal
quiz pulls down your average. If your score on the most recent quiz is
higher than the average on previous quizzes, the marginal quiz pulls up
your average. In this same way, low marginal costs of production first
pull down average costs and then higher marginal costs pull them up.

The numerical calculations behind average cost, average variable cost,
and marginal cost will change from firm to firm. However, the general
patterns of these curves, and the relationships and economic intuition
behind them, will not change.

#### Lessons from Alternative Measures of Costs

Breaking down total costs into fixed cost, marginal cost, average total
cost, and average variable cost is useful because each statistic offers
its own insights for the firm.

Whatever the firm's quantity of production, total revenue must exceed
total costs if it is to earn a profit. As explored in @sec-chapter-2,
fixed costs are often sunk costs that a firm cannot recoup. In thinking
about what to do next, typically you should ignore sunk costs, since you
have already spent this money and cannot make any changes. However, you
can change variable costs, so they convey information about the firm's
ability to cut costs in the present and the extent to which costs will
increase if production rises.

#### Clear It Up {#clear-it-up-1 .Heading3Grey}

##### Why are total cost and average cost not on the same graph? {#why-are-total-cost-and-average-cost-not-on-the-same-graph .Heading4Grey}

Total cost, fixed cost, and variable cost each reflect different aspects
of the cost of production over the entire quantity of output produced.
We measure these costs in dollars. In contrast, marginal cost, average
cost, and average variable cost are costs per unit. In the previous
example, we measured them as dollars per haircut. Thus, it would not
make sense to put all of these numbers on the same graph, since we
measure them in different units (\$ versus \$ per unit of output).

It would be as if the vertical axis measured two different things. In
addition, as a practical matter, if they were on the same graph, the
lines for marginal cost, average cost, and average variable cost would
appear almost flat against the horizontal axis, compared to the values
for total cost, fixed cost, and variable cost. Using the figures from
the previous example, the total cost of producing 40 haircuts is \$320.
However, the average cost is \$320/40, or \$8. If you graphed both total
and average cost on the same axes, the average cost would hardly show.

Average cost tells a firm whether it can earn profits given the current
price in the market. If we divide profit by the quantity of output
produced we get average profit, also known as the firm's *profit
margin*. Expanding the equation for profit gives:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { average profit } & =\frac{\text { profit }}{\text { quantity produced }} \\
& =\frac{\text { total revenue }- \text { total cost }}{\text { quantity produced }} \\
& =\frac{\text { total revenue }}{\text { quantity produced }}-\frac{\text { total cost }}{\text { quantity produced }} \\
& =\text { average revenue }- \text { average cost }
\end{aligned}
$$

However, note that:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { average revenue } & =\frac{\text { price } \times \text { quantity produced }}{\text { quantity produced }} \\
& =\text { price }
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus:

$$
\text { average profit }=\text { price }- \text { average cost }
$$

This is the firm's profit margin. This definition implies that if the
market price is above average cost, average profit, and thus total
profit, will be positive. If price is below average cost, then profits
will be negative.

We can compare this marginal cost of producing an additional unit with
the marginal revenue gained by selling that additional unit to reveal
whether the additional unit is adding to total profit---or not. Thus,
marginal cost helps producers understand how increasing or decreasing
production affects profits.

#### A Variety of Cost Patterns

The pattern of costs varies among industries and even among firms in the
same industry. Some businesses have high fixed costs, but low marginal
costs. Consider, for example, an internet company that provides medical
advice to customers. Consumers might pay such a company directly, or
perhaps hospitals or healthcare practices might subscribe on behalf of
their patients. Setting up the website, collecting the information,
writing the content, and buying or leasing the computer space to handle
the web traffic are all fixed costs that the company must undertake
before the site can work. However, when the website is up and running,
it can provide a high quantity of service with relatively low variable
costs, like the cost of monitoring the system and updating the
information. In this case, the total cost curve might start at a high
level, because of the high fixed costs, but then might appear close to
flat, up to a large quantity of output, reflecting the low variable
costs of operation. If the website is popular, however, a large rise in
the number of visitors will overwhelm the website, and increasing output
further could require a purchase of additional computer space.

For other firms, fixed costs may be relatively low. For example,
consider firms that rake leaves in the fall or shovel snow off sidewalks
and driveways in the winter. For fixed costs, such firms may need little
more than a car to transport workers to homes of customers and some
rakes and shovels. Still other firms may find that diminishing marginal
returns set in quite sharply. If a manufacturing plant tried to run 24
hours a day, seven days a week, little time remains for routine
equipment maintenance, and marginal costs can increase dramatically as
the firm struggles to repair and replace overworked equipment.

Every firm can gain insight into its task of earning profits by dividing
its total costs into fixed and variable costs, and then using these
calculations as a basis for average total cost, average variable cost,
and marginal cost. However, making a final decision about the
profit-maximizing quantity to produce and the price to charge will
require combining these perspectives on cost with an analysis of sales
and revenue, which in turn requires looking at the market structure in
which the firm finds itself. Before we turn to the analysis of market
structure in other chapters, we will analyze the firm's cost structure
from a long-run perspective.


### 7.4 Production in the Long Run

#### Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

-   Understand how long run production differs from short run
    production.

In the long run, all factors (including capital) are variable, so our
production function is $Q = f\left\lbrack L\text{,}\ K \right\rbrack$.

Consider a secretarial firm that does typing for hire using typists for
labor and personal computers for capital. To start, the firm has just
enough business for one typist and one PC to keep busy for a day. Say
that's five documents. Now suppose the firm receives a rush order from a
good customer for 10 documents tomorrow. Ideally, the firm would like to
use two typists and two PCs to produce twice their normal output of five
documents. However, in the short turn, the firm has fixed capital, i.e.
only one PC. The table below shows the situation:

| # Typists (L) | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |   |
|---------------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Letters/hr (TP) | 5 | 7 | 8 | 8 | 8 | 8 | For K = 1PC |
| MP | 5 | 2 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |   |

: Short Run Production Function for Typing {#tbl-table_7_11}

In the short run, the only variable factor is labor so the only way the
firm can produce more output is by hiring additional workers. What could
the second worker do? What can they contribute to the firm? Perhaps they
can answer the phone, which is a major impediment to completing the
typing assignment. What about a third worker? Perhaps the third worker
could bring coffee to the first two workers. You can see both total
product and marginal product for the firm above. Now here's something to
think about: At what point (e.g., after how many workers) does
diminishing marginal productivity kick in, and more importantly, why?

In this example, marginal productivity starts to decline after the
second worker. This is because capital is fixed. The production process
for typing works best with one worker and one PC. If you add more than
one typist, you get seriously diminishing marginal productivity.

Consider the long run. Suppose the firm's demand increases to 15
documents per day. What might the firm do to operate more efficiently?
If demand has tripled, the firm could acquire two more PCs, which would
give us a new short run production function as @tbl-table_7_12
below shows.

| # Typists (L) | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 5 |   |
|---------------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Letters/hr (TP) | 5 | 6 | 8 | 8 | 8 | 8 | For K = 1PC   |
| MP            | 5 | 2 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |   |
| Letters/hr (TP) | 5 | 10 | 15 | 17 | 18 | 18 | For K = 3PC   |
| MP            | 5 | 5 | 5 | 2 | 1 | 0 |   |

: Long Run Production Function for Typing {#tbl-table_7_12}

With more capital, the firm can hire three workers before diminishing
productivity comes into effect. More generally, because all factors are
variable, the long run production function shows the most efficient way
of producing any level of output.


### 7.5 Costs in the Long Run

#### Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

-   Calculate long run total cost
-   Identify economies of scale, diseconomies of scale, and constant
    returns to scale
-   Interpret graphs of long-run average cost curves and short-run
    average cost curves
-   Analyze cost and production in the long run and short run

The long run is the period of time when all costs are variable. The long
run depends on the specifics of the firm in question---it is not a
precise period of time. If you have a one-year lease on your factory,
then the long run is any period longer than a year, since after a year
you are no longer bound by the lease. No costs are fixed in the long
run. A firm can build new factories and purchase new machinery, or it
can close existing facilities. In planning for the long run, the firm
will compare alternative production technologies (or processes).

In this context, technology refers to all alternative methods of
combining inputs to produce outputs. It does not refer to a specific new
invention like the tablet computer. The firm will search for the
production technology that allows it to produce the desired level of
output at the lowest cost. After all, lower costs lead to higher
profits---at least if total revenues remain unchanged. Moreover, each
firm must fear that if it does not seek out the lowest-cost methods of
production, then it may lose sales to competitor firms that find a way
to produce and sell for less.

#### Choice of Production Technology

A firm can perform many tasks with a range of combinations of labor and
physical capital. For example, a firm can have human beings answering
phones and taking messages, or it can invest in an automated voicemail
system. A firm can hire file clerks and secretaries to manage a system
of paper folders and file cabinets, or it can invest in a computerized
recordkeeping system that will require fewer employees. A firm can hire
workers to push supplies around a factory on rolling carts, it can
invest in motorized vehicles, or it can invest in robots that carry
materials without a driver. Firms often face a choice between buying a
many small machines, which need a worker to run each one, or buying one
larger and more expensive machine, which requires only one or two
workers to operate it. In short, physical capital and labor can often
substitute for each other.

Consider the example of local governments hiring a private firm to clean
up public parks. Three different combinations of labor and physical
capital for cleaning up a single average-sized park appear in @tbl-table_7_13. The first production technology is heavy on workers
and light on machines, while the next two technologies substitute
machines for workers. Since all three of these production methods
produce the same thing---one cleaned-up park---a profit-seeking firm
will choose the production technology that is least expensive, given the
prices of labor and machines.

| Production Technology | Workers | Machines |
|------------------------|---------|----------|
| 1                      | 10      | 2        |
| 2                      | 7       | 4        |
| 3                      | 3       | 7        |

: Three Ways to Clean a Park {#tbl-table_7_13}

Production technology 1 uses the most labor and least machinery, while
production technology 3 uses the least labor and the most machinery.
@tbl-table_7_14 outlines three examples of how the total cost
will change with each production technology as the cost of labor
changes. As the cost of labor rises from example A to B to C, the firm
will choose to substitute away from labor and use more machinery.

| Example                 | Labor Cost               | Machine Cost             | Total Cost               |
|-------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| Cost of technology 1    | 10 × $40 = $400         | 2 × $80 = $160          | $560                     |
| Cost of technology 2    | 7 × $40 = $280          | 4 × $80 = $320          | $600                     |
| Cost of technology 3    | 3 × $40 = $120          | 7 × $80 = $560          | $680                     |

: Total Cost with Rising Labor Costs {#tbl-table_7_14}

Example A shows the firm's cost calculation when wages are \$40 and
machines costs are \$80. In this case, technology 1 is the low-cost
production technology. In example B, wages rise to \$55, while the cost
of machines does not change, in which case technology 2 is the low-cost
production technology. If wages keep rising up to \$90, while the cost
of machines remains unchanged, then technology 3 clearly becomes the
low-cost form of production, as example C shows.

This example shows that as an input becomes more expensive (in this
case, the labor input), firms will attempt to conserve on using that
input and will instead shift to other inputs that are relatively less
expensive. This pattern helps to explain why the demand curve for labor
(or any input) slopes down; that is, as labor becomes relatively more
expensive, profit-seeking firms will seek to substitute the use of other
inputs. When a multinational employer like Coca-Cola or McDonald's sets
up a bottling plant or a restaurant in a high-wage economy like the
United States, Canada, Japan, or Western Europe, it is likely to use
production technologies that conserve on the number of workers and
focuses more on machines. However, that same employer is likely to use
production technologies with more workers and less machinery when
producing in a lower-wage country like Mexico, China, or South Africa.

#### Economies of Scale

Once a firm has determined the least costly production technology, it
can consider the optimal scale of production, or quantity of output to
produce. Many industries experience economies of scale. Economies of
scale refers to the situation where, as the quantity of output goes up,
the cost per unit goes down. This is the idea behind "warehouse stores"
like Costco or Walmart. In everyday language: a larger factory can
produce at a lower average cost than a smaller factory.

[Figure 7.9](#fig-7_9) illustrates the idea of economies of
scale, showing the average cost of producing an alarm clock falling as
the quantity of output rises. For a small-sized factory like S, with an
output level of 1,000, the average cost of production is \$12 per alarm
clock. For a medium-sized factory like M, with an output level of 2,000,
the average cost of production falls to \$8 per alarm clock. For a large
factory like L, with an output of 5,000, the average cost of production
declines still further to \$4 per alarm clock.

![](media/7-5-costs-in-the-long-run_rId26.jpeg){width="4.875in" height="2.37in" #fig-7_9}

Figure 7.9 Economies of Scale A small factory like S produces 1,000
alarm clocks at an average cost of \$12 per clock. A medium factory like
M produces 2,000 alarm clocks at a cost of \$8 per clock. A large
factory like L produces 5,000 alarm clocks at a cost of \$4 per clock.
Economies of scale exist when the larger scale of production leads to
lower average costs.

The average cost curve in [Figure 7.9](#fig-7_9) may appear
similar to the average cost curves we presented earlier in this chapter,
although it is downward-sloping rather than U-shaped. However, there is
one major difference. The economies of scale curve is a long-run average
cost curve, because it allows all factors of production to change. The
short-run average cost curves we presented earlier in this chapter
assumed the existence of fixed costs, and only variable costs were
allowed to change.

One prominent example of economies of scale occurs in the chemical
industry. Chemical plants have many pipes. The cost of the materials for
producing a pipe is related to the circumference of the pipe and its
length. However, the cross-section area of the pipe determines the
volume of chemicals that can flow through it. The calculations in @tbl-table_7_15 show that a pipe which uses twice as much material
to make (as shown by the circumference) can actually carry four times
the volume of chemicals because the pipe\'s cross-section area rises by
a factor of four (as the Area column below shows).

| Pipe Size      | Circumference (2πr) | Area (πr^2)          |
|----------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| 4-inch pipe    | 12.5 inches          | 12.5 square inches   |
| 8-inch pipe    | 25.1 inches          | 50.2 square inches   |
| 16-inch pipe   | 50.2 inches          | 201.1 square inches  |

: Comparing Pipes: Economies of Scale in the Chemical Industry {#tbl-table_7_15}

A doubling of the cost of producing the pipe allows the chemical firm to
process four times as much material. This pattern is a major reason for
economies of scale in chemical production, which uses a large quantity
of pipes. Of course, economies of scale in a chemical plant are more
complex than this simple calculation suggests. However, the chemical
engineers who design these plants have long used what they call the
"six-tenths rule," a rule of thumb which holds that increasing the
quantity produced in a chemical plant by a certain percentage will
increase total cost by only six-tenths as much.

#### Shapes of Long-Run Average Cost Curves

While in the short run firms are limited to operating on a single
average cost curve (corresponding to the level of fixed costs they have
chosen), in the long run when all costs are variable, they can choose to
operate on any average cost curve. Thus, the long-run average cost
(LRAC) curve is actually based on a group of short-run average cost
(SRAC) curves, each of which represents one specific level of fixed
costs. More precisely, the long-run average cost curve will be the least
expensive average cost curve for any level of output. [Figure
7.10](#fig-7_10) shows how we build the long-run average cost
curve from a group of short-run average cost curves. Five
short-run-average cost curves appear on the diagram. Each SRAC curve
represents a different level of fixed costs. For example, you can
imagine SRAC~1~ as a small factory, SRAC~2~ as a medium factory, SRAC~3~
as a large factory, and SRAC~4~ and SRAC~5~ as very large and
ultra-large. Although this diagram shows only five SRAC curves,
presumably there are an infinite number of other SRAC curves between the
ones that we show. Think of this family of short-run average cost curves
as representing different choices for a firm that is planning its level
of investment in fixed cost physical capital---knowing that different
choices about capital investment in the present will cause it to end up
with different short-run average cost curves in the future.

![](media/7-5-costs-in-the-long-run_rId33.jpeg){width="4.875in" height="2.67in" #fig-7_10}

Figure 7.10 From Short-Run Average Cost Curves to Long-Run Average Cost
Curves The five different short-run average cost (SRAC) curves each
represents a different level of fixed costs, from the low level of fixed
costs at SRAC~1~ to the high level of fixed costs at SRAC~5~. Other SRAC
curves, not in the diagram, lie between the ones that are here. The
long-run average cost (LRAC) curve shows the lowest cost for producing
each quantity of output when fixed costs can vary, and so it is formed
by the bottom edge of the family of SRAC curves. If a firm wished to
produce quantity Q~3~, it would choose the fixed costs associated with
SRAC~3~.

The long-run average cost curve shows the cost of producing each
quantity in the long run, when the firm can choose its level of fixed
costs and thus choose which short-run average costs it desires. If the
firm plans to produce in the long run at an output of Q~3~, it should
make the set of investments that will lead it to locate on SRAC~3~,
which allows producing q~3~ at the lowest cost. A firm that intends to
produce Q~3~ would be foolish to choose the level of fixed costs at
SRAC~2~ or SRAC~4~. At SRAC~2~ the level of fixed costs is too low for
producing Q~3~ at lowest possible cost, and producing q~3~ would require
adding a very high level of variable costs and make the average cost
very high. At SRAC~4~, the level of fixed costs is too high for
producing q~3~ at lowest possible cost, and again average costs would be
very high as a result.

The shape of the long-run cost curve, in [Figure
7.10](#fig-7_10), is fairly common for many industries. The
left-hand portion of the long-run average cost curve, where it is
downward- sloping from output levels Q~1~ to Q~2~ to Q~3~, illustrates
the case of economies of scale. In this portion of the long-run average
cost curve, larger scale leads to lower average costs. We illustrated
this pattern earlier in [Figure 7.9](#fig-7_9).

In the middle portion of the long-run average cost curve, the flat
portion of the curve around Q~3~, economies of scale have been
exhausted. In this situation, allowing all inputs to expand does not
much change the average cost of production. We call this constant
returns to scale. In this LRAC curve range, the average cost of
production does not change much as scale rises or falls. The following
Clear It Up feature explains where diminishing marginal returns fit into
this analysis.

#### Clear It Up {#clear-it-up .Heading3Grey}

##### How do economies of scale compare to diminishing marginal returns? {#how-do-economies-of-scale-compare-to-diminishing-marginal-returns .Heading4Grey}

The concept of economies of scale, where average costs decline as
production expands, might seem to conflict with the idea of diminishing
marginal returns, where marginal costs rise as production expands.
However, diminishing marginal returns refers only to the short-run
average cost curve, where one variable input (like labor) is increasing,
but other inputs (like capital) are fixed. Economies of scale refers to
the long-run average cost curve where all inputs are allowed to increase
together. Thus, it is quite possible and common to have an industry that
has both diminishing marginal returns when only one input is allowed to
change, and at the same time has economies of scale when all inputs
change together to produce a larger-scale operation.

Finally, the right-hand portion of the long-run average cost curve,
running from output level Q~4~ to Q~5~, shows a situation where, as the
level of output and the scale rises, average costs rise as well. We call
this situation diseconomies of scale. A firm or a factory can grow so
large that it becomes very difficult to manage, resulting in
unnecessarily high costs as many layers of management try to communicate
with workers and with each other, and as failures to communicate lead to
disruptions in the flow of work and materials. Not many overly large
factories exist in the real world, because with their very high
production costs, they are unable to compete for long against plants
with lower average costs of production. However, in some planned
economies, like the economy of the old Soviet Union, plants that were so
large as to be grossly inefficient were able to continue operating for a
long time because government economic planners protected them from
competition and ensured that they would not make losses.

Diseconomies of scale can also be present across an entire firm, not
just a large factory. The leviathan effect can hit firms that become too
large to run efficiently, across the entirety of the enterprise. Firms
that shrink their operations are often responding to finding itself in
the diseconomies region, thus moving back to a lower average cost at a
lower output level.

#### The Size and Number of Firms in an Industry

The shape of the long-run average cost curve has implications for how
many firms will compete in an industry, and whether the firms in an
industry have many different sizes, or tend to be the same size. For
example, say that the appliance industry sells one million dishwashers
every year at a price of \$500 each and the long-run average cost curve
for dishwashers is in [Figure 7.11](#fig-7_11) (a). In [Figure
7.11](#fig-7_11) (a), the lowest point of the LRAC curve occurs
at a quantity of 10,000 produced. Thus, the market for dishwashers will
consist of 100 different manufacturing plants of this same size. If some
firms built a plant that produced 5,000 dishwashers per year or 25,000
dishwashers per year, the average costs of production at such plants
would be well above \$500, and the firms would not be able to compete.

![](media/7-5-costs-in-the-long-run_rId44.jpeg){width="6.5in" height="2.43in" #fig-7_11}

Figure 7.11 The LRAC Curve and the Size and Number of Firms (a) Low-cost
firms will produce at output level R. When the LRAC curve has a clear
minimum point, then any firm producing a different quantity will have
higher costs. In this case, a firm producing at a quantity of 10,000
will produce at a lower average cost than a firm producing, say, 5,000
or 20,000 units. (b) Low-cost firms will produce between output levels R
and S. When the LRAC curve has a flat bottom, then firms producing at
any quantity along this flat bottom can compete. In this case, any firm
producing a quantity between 5,000 and 20,000 can compete effectively,
although firms producing less than 5,000 or more than 20,000 would face
higher average costs and be unable to compete.

#### Clear It Up {#clear-it-up-1 .Heading3Grey}

##### How can we view cities as examples of economies of scale? {#how-can-we-view-cities-as-examples-of-economies-of-scale .Heading4Grey}

Why are people and economic activity concentrated in cities, rather than
distributed evenly across a country? The fundamental reason must be
related to the idea of economies of scale---that grouping economic
activity is more productive in many cases than spreading it out. For
example, cities provide a large group of nearby customers, so that
businesses can produce at an efficient economy of scale. They also
provide a large group of workers and suppliers, so that business can
hire easily and purchase whatever specialized inputs they need. Many of
the attractions of cities, like sports stadiums and museums, can operate
only if they can draw on a large nearby population base. Cities are big
enough to offer a wide variety of products, which is what appeals to
many shoppers.

These factors are not exactly economies of scale in the narrow sense of
the production function of a single firm, but they are related to growth
in the overall size of population and market in an area. Cities are
sometimes called "agglomeration economies."

These agglomeration factors help to explain why every economy, as it
develops, has an increasing proportion of its population living in urban
areas. In the United States, about 80% of the population now lives in
metropolitan areas (which include the suburbs around cities), compared
to just 40% in 1900. However, in poorer nations of the world, including
much of Africa, the proportion of the population in urban areas is only
about 30%. One of the great challenges for these countries as their
economies grow will be to manage the growth of the great cities that
will arise.

If cities offer economic advantages that are a form of economies of
scale, then why don't all or most people live in one giant city? At some
point, agglomeration economies must turn into diseconomies. For example,
traffic congestion may reach a point where the gains from being
geographically nearby are counterbalanced by how long it takes to
travel. High densities of people, cars, and factories can mean more
garbage and air and water pollution. Facilities like parks or museums
may become overcrowded. There may be economies of scale for negative
activities like crime, because high densities of people and businesses,
combined with the greater impersonality of cities, make it easier for
illegal activities as well as legal ones. The future of cities, both in
the United States and in other countries around the world, will be
determined by their ability to benefit from the economies of
agglomeration and to minimize or counterbalance the corresponding
diseconomies.

We illustrate a more common case in [Figure 7.11](#fig-7_11)
(b), where the LRAC curve has a flat-bottomed area of constant returns
to scale. In this situation, any firm with a level of output between
5,000 and 20,000 will be able to produce at about the same level of
average cost. Given that the market will demand one million dishwashers
per year at a price of \$500, this market might have as many as 200
producers (that is, one million dishwashers divided by firms making
5,000 each) or as few as 50 producers (one million dishwashers divided
by firms making 20,000 each). The producers in this market will range in
size from firms that make 5,000 units to firms that make 20,000 units.
However, firms that produce below 5,000 units or more than 20,000 will
be unable to compete, because their average costs will be too high.
Thus, if we see an industry where almost all plants are the same size,
it is likely that the long-run average cost curve has a unique bottom
point as in [Figure 7.11](#fig-7_11) (a). However, if the
long-run average cost curve has a wide flat bottom like [Figure
7.11](#fig-7_11) (b), then firms of a variety of different sizes
will be able to compete with each other.

We can interpret the flat section of the long-run average cost curve in
[Figure 7.11](#fig-7_11) (b) in two different ways. One
interpretation is that a single manufacturing plant producing a quantity
of 5,000 has the same average costs as a single manufacturing plant with
four times as much capacity that produces a quantity of 20,000. The
other interpretation is that one firm owns a single manufacturing plant
that produces a quantity of 5,000, while another firm owns four separate
manufacturing plants, which each produce a quantity of 5,000. This
second explanation, based on the insight that a single firm may own a
number of different manufacturing plants, is especially useful in
explaining why the long-run average cost curve often has a large flat
segment---and thus why a seemingly smaller firm may be able to compete
quite well with a larger firm. At some point, however, the task of
coordinating and managing many different plants raises the cost of
production sharply, and the long-run average cost curve slopes up as a
result.

In the examples to this point, the quantity demanded in the market is
quite large (one million) compared with the quantity produced at the
bottom of the long-run average cost curve (5,000, 10,000 or 20,000). In
such a situation, the market is set for competition between many firms.
However, what if the bottom of the long-run average cost curve is at a
quantity of 10,000 and the total market demand at that price is only
slightly higher than that quantity---or even somewhat lower?

Return to [Figure 7.11](#fig-7_11) (a), where the bottom of the
long-run average cost curve is at 10,000, but now imagine that the total
quantity of dishwashers demanded in the market at that price of \$500 is
only 30,000. In this situation, the total number of firms in the market
would be three. We call a handful of firms in a market an "oligopoly,"
and @sec-chapter-10
will discuss the range of competitive strategies that can occur when
oligopolies compete.

Alternatively, consider a situation, again in the setting of [Figure
7.11](#fig-7_11) (a), where the bottom of the long-run average
cost curve is 10,000, but total demand for the product is only 5,000.
(For simplicity, imagine that this demand is highly inelastic, so that
it does not vary according to price.) In this situation, the market may
well end up with a single firm---a monopoly---producing all 5,000 units.
If any firm tried to challenge this monopoly while producing a quantity
lower than 5,000 units, the prospective competitor firm would have a
higher average cost, and so it would not be able to compete in the
longer term without losing money. @sec-chapter-9
discusses the situation of a monopoly firm.

Thus, the shape of the long-run average cost curve reveals whether
competitors in the market will be different sizes. If the LRAC curve has
a single point at the bottom, then the firms in the market will be about
the same size, but if the LRAC curve has a flat-bottomed segment of
constant returns to scale, then firms in the market may be a variety of
different sizes.

The relationship between the quantity at the minimum of the long-run
average cost curve and the quantity demanded in the market at that price
will predict how much competition is likely to exist in the market. If
the quantity demanded in the market far exceeds the quantity at the
minimum of the LRAC, then many firms will compete. If the quantity
demanded in the market is only slightly higher than the quantity at the
minimum of the LRAC, a few firms will compete. If the quantity demanded
in the market is less than the quantity at the minimum of the LRAC, a
single-producer monopoly is a likely outcome.

#### Shifting Patterns of Long-Run Average Cost

New developments in production technology can shift the long-run average
cost curve in ways that can alter the size distribution of firms in an
industry.

For much of the twentieth century, the most common change had been to
see alterations in technology, like the assembly line or the large
department store, where large-scale producers seemed to gain an
advantage over smaller ones. In the long-run average cost curve, the
downward-sloping economies of scale portion of the curve stretched over
a larger quantity of output.

However, new production technologies do not inevitably lead to a greater
average size for firms. For example, in recent years some new
technologies for generating electricity on a smaller scale have
appeared. The traditional coal-burning electricity plants needed to
produce 300 to 600 megawatts of power to exploit economies of scale
fully. However, high-efficiency turbines to produce electricity from
burning natural gas can produce electricity at a competitive price while
producing a smaller quantity of 100 megawatts or less. These new
technologies create the possibility for smaller companies or plants to
generate electricity as efficiently as large ones. Another example of a
technology-driven shift to smaller plants may be taking place in the
tire industry. A traditional mid-size tire plant produces about six
million tires per year. However, in 2000, the Italian company Pirelli
introduced a new tire factory that uses many robots. The Pirelli tire
plant produced only about one million tires per year, but did so at a
lower average cost than a traditional mid-sized tire plant.

Controversy has simmered in recent years over whether the new
information and communications technologies will lead to a larger or
smaller size for firms. On one side, the new technology may make it
easier for small firms to reach out beyond their local geographic area
and find customers across a state, or the nation, or even across
international boundaries. This factor might seem to predict a future
with a larger number of small competitors. On the other side, perhaps
the new information and communications technology will create
"winner-take-all" markets where one large company will tend to command a
large share of total sales, as Microsoft has done producing of software
for personal computers or Amazon has done in online bookselling.
Moreover, improved information and communication technologies might make
it easier to manage many different plants and operations across the
country or around the world, and thus encourage larger firms. This
ongoing battle between the forces of smallness and largeness will be of
great interest to economists, businesspeople, and policymakers.

#### Bring It Home {#bring-it-home .Heading3Grey}

##### Amazon {#amazon .Heading4Grey}

Traditionally, bookstores have operated in retail locations with
inventories held either on the shelves or in the back of the store.
These retail locations were very pricey in terms of rent. Until
recently, Amazon had no retail locations. It only sold online and
delivered by mail. Amazon now has retail stores in California, Oregon
and Washington State and retail stores are coming to Illinois,
Massachusetts, New Jersey, and New York. Amazon offers almost any book
in print, convenient purchasing, and prompt delivery by mail. Amazon
holds its inventories in huge warehouses in low-rent locations around
the world. The warehouses are highly computerized using robots and
relatively low-skilled workers, making for low average costs per sale.
Amazon demonstrates the significant advantages economies of scale can
offer to a firm that exploits those economies.
