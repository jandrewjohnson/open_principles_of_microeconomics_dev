### Introduction to Environmental Protection and Negative Externalities

#### Bring It Home {#bring-it-home .Heading3Grey}

##### Keystone XL {#keystone-xl .Heading4Grey}

You might have heard about Keystone XL in the news. It was a pipeline
system designed to bring oil from Canada to the refineries near the Gulf
of Mexico, as well as to boost crude oil production in the United
States. While a private company, TransCanada, planned to build and own
the pipeline, U.S. government approval was required because of its size
and location. There were four phases in plans to build the pipeline, and
the first two of these had been in operation.

Sounds like a great idea, right? A pipeline that would move much needed
crude oil to the Gulf refineries would increase oil production for
manufacturing needs, reduce price pressure at the gas pump, and increase
overall economic growth. Supporters argued that the pipeline would be
one of the safest pipelines built yet, and would reduce America's
dependence on politically vulnerable Middle Eastern oil imports.

Not so fast, said its critics. The Keystone XL would be constructed over
an enormous aquifer (one of the largest in the world) in the Midwest,
and through an environmentally fragile area in Nebraska, causing great
concern among environmentalists about possible destruction to the
natural surroundings. They argued that leaks could taint valuable water
sources and pipeline construction could disrupt and even harm indigenous
species. Environmentalist groups fought government approval of the
proposed pipeline construction, and in November 2015, the Obama
administration refused to grant the cross-border permit necessary to
build the Keystone XL pipeline. In 2017, the Trump administration sought
to grant the necessary cross-border permit, and legal challenges
emerged. In 2021, President Biden, on his first day in office, canceled
the cross-border permit, effectively ending (for now) the Keystone XL
pipeline.

Environmental concerns matter when discussing issues related to economic
growth. However, how much should economists factor in these issues when
deciding policy? In the case of the pipeline, how do we know how much
damage it would cause when we do not know how to put a value on the
environment? Would the pipeline\'s benefits outweigh the opportunity
cost? The issue of how to balance economic progress with unintended
effects on our planet is the subject of this chapter.

In 1969, the Cuyahoga River in Ohio was so polluted that it
spontaneously burst into flame. Air pollution was so bad at that time
that Chattanooga, Tennessee was a city where, as an article from *Sports
Illustrated* put it: "the death rate from tuberculosis was double that
of the rest of Tennessee and triple that of the rest of the United
States, a city in which the filth in the air was so bad it melted nylon
stockings off women's legs, in which executives kept supplies of clean
white shirts in their offices so they could change when a shirt became
too gray to be presentable, in which headlights were turned on at high
noon because the sun was eclipsed by the gunk in the sky."

The problem of pollution arises for every economy in the world, whether
high-income or low-income, and whether market-oriented or
command-oriented. Every country needs to strike some balance between
production and environmental quality. This chapter begins by discussing
how firms may fail to take certain social costs, like pollution, into
their planning if they do not need to pay these costs. Traditionally,
policies for environmental protection have focused on governmental
limits on how much of each pollutant could be emitted. While this
approach has had some success, economists have suggested a range of more
flexible, market-oriented policies that reduce pollution at a lower
cost. We will consider both approaches, but first let's see how
economists frame and analyze these issues.


### 12.1 The Economics of Pollution

#### Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

-   Explain and give examples of positive and negative externalities
-   Identify equilibrium price and quantity
-   Evaluate how firms can contribute to market failure

From 1970 to 2020, the U.S. population increased by 63 percent, and the
size of the U.S. economy increased by more than 3.8-fold. Since the
1970s, however, the United States, using a variety of anti-pollution
policies, has made genuine progress against a number of pollutants.
[Table 12.1](#Table_12_01) lists the change in carbon dioxide emissions
by energy users (from residential to industrial) according to the U.S.
Energy Information Administration (EIA). The table shows that emissions
of certain key air pollutants declined substantially from 2007 to 2012.
They dropped 740 million metric tons (MMT) a year---a 12% reduction.
This seems to indicate that there has been progress made in the United
States in reducing overall carbon dioxide emissions, which contribute to
the greenhouse effect.

Table 12.1 Carbon Dioxide Emissions from Energy Consumption, by Source
(Source: EIA Monthly Energy Review)

Despite the gradual reduction in emissions from fossil fuels, many
important environmental issues remain. Along with the still high levels
of air and water pollution, other issues include hazardous waste
disposal, destruction of wetlands and other wildlife habitats, and the
impact on human health from pollution.

#### Externalities

Private markets, such as the cell phone industry, offer an efficient way
to put buyers and sellers together and determine what goods they
produce, how they produce them and who gets them. The principle that
voluntary exchange benefits both buyers and sellers is a fundamental
building block of the economic way of thinking. However, what happens
when a voluntary exchange affects a third party who is neither the buyer
nor the seller?

As an example, consider a concert producer who wants to build an outdoor
arena that will host country music concerts a half-mile from your
neighborhood. You will be able to hear these outdoor concerts while
sitting on your back porch---or perhaps even in your dining room. In
this case, the sellers and buyers of concert tickets may both be quite
satisfied with their voluntary exchange, but you have no voice in their
market transaction. The effect of a market exchange on a third party who
is outside or "external" to the exchange is called an externality.
Because externalities that occur in market transactions affect other
parties beyond those involved, they are sometimes called spillovers.

Externalities can be negative or positive. If you hate country music,
then having it waft into your house every night would be a negative
externality. If you love country music, then what amounts to a series of
free concerts would be a positive externality.

#### Pollution as a Negative Externality

Pollution is a negative externality. Economists illustrate the social
costs of production with a demand and supply diagram. The social costs
include the private costs of production that a company incurs and the
external costs of pollution that pass on to society. [Figure
12.2](#CNX_Econ_C12_001) shows the demand and supply for manufacturing
refrigerators. The demand curve (D) shows the quantity demanded at each
price. The supply curve (S~private~) shows the quantity of refrigerators
that all firms in the industry supply at each price assuming they are
taking only their private costs into account and they are allowed to
emit pollution at zero cost. The market equilibrium (E~0~), where
quantity supplied equals quantity demanded, is at a price of \$650 per
refrigerator and a quantity of 45,000 refrigerators. [Table
12.2](#Table_12_02) reflects this information in the first three
columns.

![](media/12-1-the-economics-of-pollution_rId30.jpeg){width="2.655in" height="2.77in"}

Figure 12.2 Taking Social Costs into Account: A Supply Shift If the firm
takes only its own costs of production into account, then its supply
curve will be S~private~, and the market equilibrium will occur at E~0~.
Accounting for additional external costs of \$100 for every unit
produced, the firm's supply curve will be S~social~. The new equilibrium
will occur at E~1~.

Table 12.2 A Supply Shift Caused by Pollution Costs

However, as a by-product of the metals, plastics, chemicals and energy
that refrigerator manufacturers use, some pollution is created. Let's
say that, if these pollutants were emitted into the air and water, they
would create costs of \$100 per refrigerator produced. These costs might
occur because of adverse effects on human health, property values, or
wildlife habitat, reduction of recreation possibilities, or because of
other negative impacts. In a market with no anti-pollution restrictions,
firms can dispose of certain wastes absolutely free. Now imagine that
firms which produce refrigerators must factor in these external costs of
pollution---that is, the firms have to consider not only labor and
material costs, but also the broader costs to society of harm to health
and other costs caused by pollution. If the firm is required to pay
\$100 for the additional external costs of pollution each time it
produces a refrigerator, production becomes more costly and the entire
supply curve shifts up by \$100.

As [Table 12.2](#Table_12_02) and [Figure 12.2](#CNX_Econ_C12_001)
illustrate, the firm will need to receive a price of \$700 per
refrigerator and produce a quantity of 40,000---and the firm's new
supply curve will be S~social~. The new equilibrium will occur at E~1~.
In short, taking the additional external costs of pollution into account
results in a higher price, a lower quantity of production, and a lower
quantity of pollution. The following Work It Out feature will walk you
through an example, this time with musical accompaniment.

#### Work It Out {#work-it-out .Heading3Grey}

##### Identifying the Equilibrium Price and Quantity {#identifying-the-equilibrium-price-and-quantity .Heading4Grey}

[Table 12.3](#Table_12_03) shows the supply and demand conditions for a
firm that will play trumpets on the streets when requested. We measure
output as the number of songs played.

Table 12.3 Supply and Demand Conditions for a Trumpet-Playing Firm

Step 1. Determine the negative externality in this situation. To do
this, you must think about the situation and consider all parties that
might be impacted. A negative externality might be the increase in noise
pollution in the area where the firm is playing.

Step 2. Identify the initial equilibrium price and quantity only taking
private costs into account. Next, identify the new equilibrium taking
into account social costs as well as private costs. Remember that
equilibrium is where the quantity demanded is equal to the quantity
supplied.

Step 3. Look down the columns to where the quantity demanded (the second
column) is equal to the "quantity supplied without paying the costs of
the externality" (the third column). Then refer to the first column of
that row to determine the equilibrium price. In this case, the
equilibrium price and quantity would be at a price of \$10 and a
quantity of five when we only take into account private costs.

Step 4. Identify the equilibrium price and quantity when we take into
account the additional external costs. Look down the columns of quantity
demanded (the second column) and the "quantity supplied after paying the
costs of the externality" (the fourth column) then refer to the first
column of that row to determine the equilibrium price. In this case, the
equilibrium will be at a price of \$12 and a quantity of four.

Step 5. Consider how taking into account the externality affects the
equilibrium price and quantity. Do this by comparing the two equilibrium
situations. If the firm is forced to pay its additional external costs,
then production of trumpet songs becomes more costly, and the supply
curve will shift up.

Remember that the supply curve is based on choices about production that
firms make while looking at their marginal costs, while the demand curve
is based on the benefits that individuals perceive while maximizing
utility. If no externalities existed, private costs would be the same as
the costs to society as a whole, and private benefits would be the same
as the benefits to society as a whole. Thus, if no externalities
existed, the interaction of demand and supply will coordinate social
costs and benefits.

However, when the externality of pollution exists, the supply curve no
longer represents all social costs. Because externalities represent a
case where markets no longer consider all social costs, but only some of
them, economists commonly refer to externalities as an example of market
failure. When there is market failure, the private market fails to
achieve efficient output, because either firms do not account for all
costs incurred in the production of output and/or consumers do not
account for all benefits obtained (a positive externality). In the case
of pollution, at the market output, social costs of production exceed
social benefits to consumers, and the market produces too much of the
product.

We can see a general lesson here. If firms were required to pay the
social costs of pollution, they would create less pollution but produce
less of the product and charge a higher price. In the next module, we
will explore how governments require firms to account for the social
costs of pollution.


### 12.2 Command-and-Control Regulation

#### Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

-   Explain command-and-control regulation
-   Evaluate the effectiveness of command-and-control regulation

When the United States started passing comprehensive environmental laws
in the late 1960s and early 1970s, a typical law specified to companies
how much pollution their smokestacks or drainpipes could emit and
imposed penalties if companies exceeded the limit. Other laws required
that companies install certain equipment---for example, on automobile
tailpipes or on smokestacks---to reduce pollution. These types of laws,
which specify allowable quantities of pollution and which also may
detail which pollution-control technologies companies must use, fall
under the category of command-and-control regulation. In effect,
command-and-control regulation requires that firms increase their costs
by installing anti-pollution equipment. Thus, firms are required to
account for the social costs of pollution in deciding how much output to
produce.

Command-and-control regulation has been highly successful in protecting
and cleaning up the U.S. environment. In 1970, the Federal government
created the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to oversee all
environmental laws. In the same year, Congress enacted the Clean Air Act
to address air pollution. Just two years later, in 1972, Congress passed
and the president signed the far-reaching Clean Water Act. These
command-and-control environmental laws, and their amendments and
updates, have been largely responsible for America's cleaner air and
water in recent decades. However, economists have pointed out three
difficulties with command-and-control environmental regulation.

First, command-and-control regulation offers no incentive to improve the
quality of the environment beyond the standard set by a particular law.
Once firms meet the standard, polluters have zero incentive to do
better.

Second, command-and-control regulation is inflexible. It usually
requires the same standard for all polluters, and often the same
pollution-control technology as well. This means that
command-and-control regulation draws no distinctions between firms that
would find it easy and inexpensive to meet the pollution standard---or
to reduce pollution even further---and firms that might find it
difficult and costly to meet the standard. Firms have no reason to
rethink their production methods in fundamental ways that might reduce
pollution even more and at lower cost.

Third, legislators and EPA analysts write the command-and-control
regulations, and so they are subject to compromises in the political
process. Existing firms often argue (and lobby) that stricter
environmental standards should not apply to them, only to new firms that
wish to start production. Consequently, real-world environmental laws
are full of fine print, loopholes, and exceptions.

Although critics accept the goal of reducing pollution, they question
whether command-and-control regulation is the best way to design policy
tools for accomplishing that goal. A different approach is the use of
market-oriented tools, which we discussed in the next section.


### 12.3 Market-Oriented Environmental Tools

#### Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

-   Show how pollution charges impact firm decisions
-   Suggest other laws and regulations that could fall under pollution
    charges
-   Explain the significance of marketable permits and property rights
-   Evaluate which policies are most appropriate for various situations

Market-oriented environmental policies create incentives to allow firms
some flexibility in reducing pollution. The three main categories of
market-oriented approaches to pollution control are pollution charges,
marketable permits, and better-defined property rights. All of these
policy tools which we discuss, below, address the shortcomings of
command-and-control regulation---albeit in different ways.

#### Pollution Charges

A pollution charge is a tax imposed on the quantity of pollution that a
firm emits. A pollution charge gives a profit-maximizing firm an
incentive to determine ways to reduce its emissions---as long as the
marginal cost of reducing the emissions is less than the tax.

For example, consider a small firm that emits 50 pounds per year of
small particles, such as soot, into the air. This particulate matter
causes respiratory illnesses and also imposes costs on firms and
individuals.

[Figure 12.3](#CNX_Econ_C12_002) illustrates the marginal costs that a
firm faces in reducing pollution. The marginal cost of pollution
reduction, like most marginal cost curves, increases with output, at
least in the short run. Reducing the first 10 pounds of particulate
emissions costs the firm \$300. Reducing the second 10 pounds would cost
\$500; reducing the third ten pounds would cost \$900; reducing the
fourth 10 pounds would cost \$1,500; and the fifth 10 pounds would cost
\$2,500. This pattern for the costs of reducing pollution is common,
because the firm can use the cheapest and easiest method to make initial
reductions in pollution, but additional reductions in pollution become
more expensive.

![](media/12-3-market-oriented-environmental-tools_rId24.jpeg){width="4.88in" height="3.005in"}

Figure 12.3 A Pollution Charge If a pollution charge is set equal to
\$1,000, then the firm will have an incentive to reduce pollution by 30
pounds because the \$900 cost of these reductions would be less than the
cost of paying the pollution charge.

Imagine the firm now faces a pollution tax of \$1,000 for every 10
pounds of particulates it emits. The firm has the choice of either
polluting and paying the tax, or reducing the amount of particulates it
emits and paying the cost of abatement as the figure shows. How much
will the firm pollute and how much will the firm abate? The first 10
pounds would cost the firm \$300 to abate. This is substantially less
than the \$1,000 tax, so the firm will choose to abate. The second 10
pounds would cost \$500 to abate, which is still less than the tax, so
it will choose to abate. The third 10 pounds would cost \$900 to abate,
which is slightly less than the \$1,000 tax. The fourth 10 pounds would
cost \$1,500, which is much more costly than paying the tax. As a
result, the firm will decide to reduce pollutants by 30 pounds, because
the marginal cost of reducing pollution by this amount is less than the
pollution tax. With a tax of \$1,000, the firm has no incentive to
reduce pollution more than 30 pounds.

A firm that has to pay a pollution tax will have an incentive to figure
out the least expensive technologies for reducing pollution. Firms that
can reduce pollution cheaply and easily will do so to minimize their
pollution taxes; whereas firms that will incur high costs for reducing
pollution will end up paying the pollution tax instead. If the pollution
tax applies to every source of pollution, then there are no special
favoritism or loopholes for politically well-connected producers.

For an example of a pollution charge at the household level, consider
two ways of charging for garbage collection. One method is to have a
flat fee per household, no matter how much garbage a household produces.
An alternative approach is to have several levels of fees, depending on
how much garbage the household produces---and to offer lower or free
charges for recyclable materials. As of 2006 (latest statistics
available), the EPA had recorded over 7,000 communities that have
implemented "pay as you throw" programs. When people have a financial
incentive to put out less garbage and to increase recycling, they find
ways to make it happen.

A number of environmental policies are really pollution charges,
although they often do not travel under that name. For example, the
federal government and many state governments impose taxes on gasoline.
We can view this tax as a charge on the air pollution that cars generate
as well as a source of funding for maintaining roads. Gasoline taxes are
far higher in most other countries than in the United States.

Similarly, the refundable charge of five or 10 cents that only 10 states
have for returning recyclable cans and bottles works like a pollution
tax that provides an incentive to avoid littering or throwing bottles in
the trash. Compared with command-and-control regulation, a pollution tax
reduces pollution in a more flexible and cost-effective way.

current U.S. states with bottle bills and the states that have active
campaigns for new bottle bills. You can also view current and proposed
bills in Canada and other countries around the world.

#### Marketable Permits

When a city or state government sets up a marketable permit program
(e.g., cap-and-trade), it must start by determining the overall quantity
of pollution it will allow as it tries to meet national pollution
standards. Then, it divides a number of permits allowing only this
quantity of pollution among the firms that emit that pollutant. The
government can sell or provide these permits to pollute free to firms.

Now, add two more conditions. Imagine that these permits are designed to
reduce total emissions over time. For example, a permit may allow
emission of 10 units of pollution one year, but only nine units the next
year, then eight units the year after that, and so on down to some lower
level. In addition, imagine that these are marketable permits, meaning
that firms can buy and sell them.

To see how marketable permits can work to reduce pollution, consider the
four firms in [Table 12.4](#Table_12_06). The table shows current
emissions of lead from each firm. At the start of the marketable permit
program, each firm receives permits to allow this level of pollution.
However, these permits are shrinkable, and next year the permits allow
the firms to emit only half as much pollution. Let's say that in a year,
Firm Gamma finds it easy and cheap to reduce emissions from 600 tons of
lead to 200 tons, which means that it has permits that it is not using
that allow emitting 100 tons of lead. Firm Beta reduces its lead
pollution from 400 tons to 200 tons, so it does not need to buy any
permits, and it does not have any extra permits to sell. However,
although Firm Alpha can easily reduce pollution from 200 tons to 150
tons, it finds that it is cheaper to purchase permits from Gamma rather
than to reduce its own emissions to 100. Meanwhile, Firm Delta did not
even exist in the first period, so the only way it can start production
is to purchase permits to emit 50 tons of lead.

The total quantity of pollution will decline. However, buying and
selling the marketable permits will determine exactly which firms reduce
pollution and by how much. With a system of marketable permits, the
firms that find it least expensive to do so will reduce pollution the
most.

Table 12.4 How Marketable Permits Work

Another application of marketable permits occurred when the U.S.
government amended the Clean Air Act in 1990. The revised law sought to
reduce sulfur dioxide emissions from electric power plants to half of
the 1980 levels out of concern that sulfur dioxide was causing acid
rain, which harms forests as well as buildings. In this case, the
marketable permits the federal government issued were free of charge (no
pun intended) to electricity-generating plants across the country,
especially those that were burning coal (which produces sulfur dioxide).
These permits were of the "shrinkable" type; that is, the amount of
pollution allowed by a given permit declined with time.

#### Better-Defined Property Rights

A clarified and strengthened idea of property rights can also strike a
balance between economic activity and pollution. Ronald Coase
(1910--2013), who won the 1991 Nobel Prize in economics, offered a vivid
illustration of an externality: a railroad track running beside a
farmer's field where the railroad locomotive sometimes emits sparks and
sets the field ablaze. Coase asked whose responsibility it was to
address this spillover. Should the farmer be required to build a tall
fence alongside the field to block the sparks, or should the railroad be
required to place a gadget on the locomotive's smokestack to reduce the
number of sparks?

Coase pointed out that one cannot resolve this issue until one clearly
defines property rights---that is, the legal rights of ownership on
which others are not allowed to infringe without paying compensation.
Does the farmer have a property right not to have a field burned? Does
the railroad have a property right to run its own trains on its own
tracks? If neither party has a property right, then the two sides may
squabble endlessly, doing nothing, and sparks will continue to set the
field aflame. However, if either the farmer or the railroad has a
well-defined legal responsibility, then that party will seek out and pay
for the least costly method of reducing the risk that sparks will hit
the field. The property right determines whether the farmer or the
railroad pays the bills.

The property rights approach is highly relevant in cases involving
endangered species. The U.S. government's endangered species list
includes about 1,000 plants and animals, and about 90% of these species
live on privately owned land. The protection of these endangered species
requires careful thinking about incentives and property rights. The
discovery of an endangered species on private land has often triggered
an automatic reaction from the government to prohibit the landowner from
using that land for any purpose that might disturb the imperiled
creatures. Consider the incentives of that policy: If you admit to the
government that you have an endangered species, the government
effectively prohibits you from using your land. As a result, rumors
abounded of landowners who followed a policy of "shoot, shovel, and shut
up" when they found an endangered animal on their land. Other landowners
have deliberately cut trees or managed land in a way that they knew
would discourage endangered animals from locating there.

#### Clear It Up {#clear-it-up .Heading3Grey}

##### How effective are market-oriented environmental policy tools? {#how-effective-are-market-oriented-environmental-policy-tools .Heading4Grey}

Environmentalists sometimes fear that market-oriented environmental
tools are an excuse to weaken or eliminate strict limits on pollution
emissions and instead to allow more pollution. It is true that if
pollution charges are set very low or if marketable permits do not
reduce pollution by very much then market-oriented tools will not work
well. However, command-and-control environmental laws can also be full
of loopholes or have exemptions that do not reduce pollution by much,
either. The advantage of market-oriented environmental tools is not that
they reduce pollution by more or less, but because of their incentives
and flexibility, they can achieve any desired reduction in pollution at
a lower cost to society.

A more productive policy would consider how to provide private
landowners with an incentive to protect the endangered species that they
find and to provide a habitat for additional endangered species. For
example, the government might pay landowners who provide and maintain
suitable habitats for endangered species or who restrict the use of
their land to protect an endangered species. Again, an environmental law
built on incentives and flexibility offers greater promise than a
command-and-control approach when trying to oversee millions of acres of
privately owned land.

#### Applying Market-Oriented Environmental Tools

Market-oriented environmental policies are a tool kit. Specific policy
tools will work better in some situations than in others. For example,
marketable permits work best when a few dozen or a few hundred parties
are highly interested in trading, as in the cases of oil refineries that
trade lead permits or electrical utilities that trade sulfur dioxide
permits. However, for cases in which millions of users emit small
amounts of pollution---such as emissions from car engines or unrecycled
soda cans---and have no strong interest in trading, pollution charges
will typically offer a better choice. We can also combine
market-oriented environmental tools. We can view marketable permits as a
form of improved property rights. Alternatively, the government could
combine marketable permits with a pollution tax on any emissions not
covered by a permit.


### 12.4 The Benefits and Costs of U.S. Environmental Laws

#### Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

-   Evaluate the benefits and costs of environmental protection
-   Explain the effects of ecotourism
-   Apply marginal analysis to illustrate the marginal costs and
    marginal benefits of reducing pollution

Government economists have estimated that U.S. firms may pay more than
\$200 billion per year to comply with federal environmental laws. That
is a sizable amount of money. Is the money well spent?

#### Benefits and Costs of Clean Air and Clean Water

We can divide the benefits of a cleaner environment into four areas: (1)
people may stay healthier and live longer; (2) certain industries that
rely on clean air and water, such as farming, fishing, and tourism, may
benefit; (3) property values may be higher; and (4) people may simply
enjoy a cleaner environment in a way that does not need to involve a
market transaction. Some of these benefits, such as gains to tourism or
farming, are relatively easy to value in economic terms. It is harder to
assign a monetary value to others, such as the value of clean air for
someone with asthma. It seems difficult to put a clear-cut monetary
value on still others, such as the satisfaction you might feel from
knowing that the air is clear over the Grand Canyon, even if you have
never visited the Grand Canyon, but advanced techniques in economics
allow one to generate estimates.

Although estimates of environmental benefits are not precise, they can
still be revealing. For example, a study by the Environmental Protection
Agency looked at the costs and benefits of the Clean Air Act from 1970
to 1990. It found that total costs over that time period were roughly
\$500 billion---a huge amount. However, it also found that a
middle-range estimate of the health and other benefits from cleaner air
was \$22 trillion---about 44 times higher than the costs. A more recent
EPA study estimated that the environmental benefits to Americans from
the Clean Air Act will exceed their costs by a margin of four to one.
The EPA estimated that "in 2010 the benefits of Clean Air Act programs
will total about \$110 billion. This estimate represents the value of
avoiding increases in illness and premature death which would have
prevailed." Saying that overall benefits of environmental regulation
have exceeded costs in the past, however, is very different from saying
that every environmental regulation makes sense. For example, studies
suggest that when breaking down emission reductions by type of
contaminants, the benefits of air pollution control outweigh the costs
primarily for particulates and lead, but when looking at other air
pollutants, the costs of reducing them may be comparable to or greater
than the benefits. Just because some environmental regulations have had
benefits much higher than costs does not prove that every individual
regulation is a sensible idea.

#### Ecotourism: Making Environmentalism Pay

The definition of ecotourism is a little vague. Does it mean sleeping on
the ground, eating roots, and getting close to wild animals? Does it
mean flying in a helicopter to shoot anesthetic darts at African
wildlife, or a little of both? The definition may be fuzzy, but tourists
who hope to appreciate the ecology of their destination---"eco
tourists"---are the impetus to a big and growing business. The
International Ecotourism Society estimates that international tourists
interested in seeing nature or wildlife would take 1.56 billion trips by
2020. While COVID-19 prevented this from happening in 2020, it is clear
that there is a strong demand for ecotourism.

International Ecotourism Society, its programs, and tourism's role in
sustainable community development.

Realizing the attraction of ecotourism, the residents of low-income
countries may come to see that preserving wildlife habitats is more
lucrative than, say, cutting down forests or grazing livestock. In South
Africa, Namibia, and Zimbabwe, for example, ecotourism has given local
communities an economic interest in protecting elephant and rhinoceros
populations. Some of the leading ecotourism destinations include Costa
Rica and Panama in Central America; the Caribbean; Malaysia, and other
South Pacific destinations; New Zealand; the Serengeti in Tanzania; the
Amazon rain forests; and the Galapagos Islands. In many of these
countries and regions, governments have enacted policies whereby they
share revenues from ecotourism with local communities, to give people in
those local communities a kind of property right that encourages them to
conserve their local environment.

Ecotourism needs careful management, so that the combination of eager
tourists and local entrepreneurs does not destroy what the visitors are
coming to see. And recent research indicates that wild animals that are
continually exposed to tourists and vehicles exhibit stress and atypical
behaviors. In general, however, well-managed ecotourism is viewed as a
net positive, which provides an alternative to damaging the local
environment.

#### Marginal Benefits and Marginal Costs

We can use the tools of marginal analysis to illustrate the marginal
costs and the marginal benefits of reducing pollution. [Figure
12.4](#CNX_Econ_C12_003) illustrates a theoretical model of this
situation. When the quantity of environmental protection is low so that
pollution is extensive---for example, at quantity Qa---there are usually
numerous relatively cheap and easy ways to reduce pollution, and the
marginal benefits of doing so are quite high. At Qa, it makes sense to
allocate more resources to fight pollution. However, as the extent of
environmental protection increases, the cheap and easy ways of reducing
pollution begin to decrease, and one must use more costly methods. The
marginal cost curve rises. Also, as environmental protection increases,
one achieves the largest marginal benefits first, followed by reduced
marginal benefits. As the quantity of environmental protection increases
to, say, Qb, the gap between marginal benefits and marginal costs
narrows. At point Qc the marginal costs will exceed the marginal
benefits. At this level of environmental protection, society is not
allocating resources efficiently, because it is forfeiting too many
resources to reduce pollution.

Figure 12.4 Marginal Costs and Marginal Benefits of Environmental
Protection Reducing pollution is costly---one must sacrifice resources.
The marginal costs of reducing pollution are generally increasing,
because one can first make the least expensive and easiest reductions,
leaving the more expensive methods for later. The marginal benefits of
reducing pollution are generally declining, because one can take the
steps that provide the greatest benefit first, and steps that provide
less benefit can wait until later.

As society draws closer to Qb, some might argue that it becomes more
important to use market-oriented environmental tools to hold down the
costs of reducing pollution. Their objective would be to avoid
environmental rules that would provide the quantity of environmental
protection at Qc, where marginal costs exceed marginal benefits. The
following Clear It Up feature delves into how the EPA measures its
policies -- and the monetary value of our lives.

#### Clear It Up {#clear-it-up .Heading3Grey}

##### What\'s a life worth? {#whats-a-life-worth .Heading4Grey}

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) must estimate the value
of saving lives by reducing pollution against the additional costs. In
measuring the benefits of government environmental policies, the EPA's
National Center for Environmental Economics (NCEE) values a statistical
human life at \$7.4 million (in 2006 U.S. dollars, which corresponds to
a little more than \$10.5 million in February 2022.)

Economists value a human life on the basis of studies of the value that
people actually place on human lives in their own decisions. For
example, some jobs have a higher probability of death than others, and
these jobs typically pay more to compensate for the risk. Examples are
ocean fishery as opposed to fish farming, and ice trucking in Alaska as
opposed to truck driving in the "lower forty-eight" states.

Government regulators use estimates such as these when deciding what
proposed regulations are "reasonable," which means deciding which
proposals have high enough benefits to justify their cost. For example,
when the U.S. Department of Transportation makes decisions about what
safety systems should be required in cars or airplanes, it will approve
rules only where the estimated cost per life saved is \$3 million or
less.

Resources that we spend on life-saving regulations create a tradeoff. A
study by W. Kip Viscusi of Vanderbilt University estimated that when a
regulation costs \$50 million, it diverts enough spending in the rest of
the economy from health care and safety expenditures that it costs a
life. This finding suggests that any regulation that costs more than
\$50 million per life saved actually costs lives, rather than saving
them.

### 12.5 International Environmental Issues

#### Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

-   Explain biodiversity
-   Analyze the partnership of high-income and low-income countries in
    efforts to address international externalities

Many countries around the world have become more aware of the benefits
of environmental protection. Yet even if most nations individually took
steps to address their environmental issues, no nation acting alone can
solve certain environmental problems which spill over national borders.
No nation by itself can reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other
gases by enough to solve the problem of global warming---not without the
cooperation of other nations. Another issue is the challenge of
preserving biodiversity, which includes the full spectrum of animal and
plant genetic material. Although a nation can protect biodiversity
within its own borders, no nation acting alone can protect biodiversity
around the world. Global warming and biodiversity are examples of
international externalities.

Bringing the nations of the world together to address environmental
issues requires a difficult set of negotiations between countries with
different income levels and different sets of priorities. If nations
such as China, India, Brazil, Mexico, and others are developing their
economies by burning vast amounts of fossil fuels or by stripping their
forest and wildlife habitats, then the world's high-income countries
acting alone will not be able to reduce greenhouse gases. However,
low-income countries, with some understandable exasperation, point out
that high-income countries do not have much moral standing to lecture
them on the necessities of putting environmental protection ahead of
economic growth. After all, high-income countries have historically been
the primary contributors to greenhouse warming by burning fossil
fuels---and still are today. It is hard to tell people who are living in
a low-income country, where adequate diet, health care, and education
are lacking, that they should sacrifice an improved quality of life for
a cleaner environment.

Can rich and poor countries come together to address global
environmental spillovers? At the initiative of the European Union and
the most vulnerable developing nations, the Durban climate conference in
December 2011 launched negotiations to develop a new international
climate change agreement that covers all countries. The outcome of these
negotiations was the Paris Climate Agreement, passed in 2015. The Paris
Agreement committed participating countries to significant limits on
CO~2~ emissions. To date, 196 entities have signed on, including the two
biggest emitters of greenhouse gases---China and the United States. The
U.S. contribution to the agreement was the Clean Power Plan, which
planned to reduce power plant CO~2~ emissions across the U.S. by 17% to
pre-2005 levels by 2020, and to further reduce emissions by a cumulative
32% by 2030. In early 2017, the Trump Administration announced plans to
back out of the Paris Climate Agreement. Trump opposed the Clean Power
plan, opting instead to shift focus to the use of natural gas. This
represented a significant blow to the success of the Paris Agreement.
However, on his first day in office, President Biden, on behalf of the
United States, rejoined the Paris Climate Agreement.

If high-income countries want low-income countries to reduce their
emission of greenhouse gases, then the high-income countries may need to
pay some of the costs. Perhaps some of these payments will happen
through private markets. For example, some tourists from rich countries
will pay handsomely to vacation near the natural treasures of low-income
countries. Perhaps some of the transfer of resources can happen through
making modern pollution-control technology available to poorer
countries.

The practical details of what such an international system might look
like and how it would operate across international borders are
forbiddingly complex. However, it seems highly unlikely that some form
of world government will impose a detailed system of environmental
command-and-control regulation around the world. As a result, a
decentralized and market-oriented approach may be the only practical way
to address international issues such as global warming and biodiversity.


### 12.6 The Tradeoff between Economic Output and Environmental Protection

#### Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

-   Apply the production possibility frontier to evaluate the tradeoff
    between economic output and the environment
-   Interpret a graphic representation of the tradeoff between economic
    output and environmental protection

We can analyze the tradeoff between economic output and the environment
with a production possibility frontier (PPF) such as the one in [Figure
12.5](#CNX_Econ_C12_004). At one extreme, at a choice like P, a country
would be selecting a high level of economic output but very little
environmental protection. At the other extreme, at a choice like T, a
country would be selecting a high level of environmental protection but
little economic output. According to the graph, an increase in
environmental protection involves an opportunity cost of less economic
output. No matter what their preferences, all societies should wish to
avoid choices like M, which are productively inefficient. Efficiency
requires that the choice should be on the production possibility
frontier.

![](media/12-6-the-tradeoff-between-economic-output-and-environmental-protection_rId23.jpeg){width="3.5in" height="2.725in"}

Figure 12.5 The Tradeoff between Economic Output and Environmental
Protection Each society will have to weigh its own values and decide
whether it prefers a choice like P with more economic output and less
environmental protection, or a choice like T with more environmental
protection and less economic output.

Economists do not have a great deal to say about the choice between P,
Q, R, S and T in [Figure 12.5](#CNX_Econ_C12_004), all of which lie
along the production possibility frontier. Countries with low per capita
gross domestic product (GDP), such as India, place a greater emphasis on
economic output---which in turn helps to produce nutrition, shelter,
health, education, and desirable consumer goods. Countries with higher
income levels, where a greater share of people have access to the basic
necessities of life, may be willing to place a relatively greater
emphasis on environmental protection.

However, economists are united in their belief that an inefficient
choice such as M is undesirable. Rather than choosing M, a nation could
achieve either greater economic output with the same environmental
protection, as at point Q, or greater environmental protection with the
same level of output, as at point S. The problem with
command-and-control environmental laws is that they sometimes involve a
choice like M. Market-oriented environmental tools offer a mechanism for
providing either the same environmental protection at lower cost, or
providing a greater degree of environmental protection for the same
cost.

#### Bring It Home {#bring-it-home .Heading3Grey}

##### Keystone XL {#keystone-xl .Heading4Grey}

How would an economist respond to claims of environmental damage caused
by the Keystone XL project? Clearly, we can consider the environmental
cost of oil spills a negative externality, but how large would these
external costs be? Furthermore, are these costs "too high" when we
measure them against any potential for economic benefit?

As this chapter indicates, in deciding whether pipeline construction is
a good idea, an economist would want to know not only about the marginal
benefits resulting from the additional pipeline construction, but also
the potential marginal costs---and especially the pipeline\'s marginal
external costs. Typically these come in the form of environmental impact
statements, which are usually required for such projects. For example,
an impact statement, released in March 2013 by the Nebraska Department
of State, considered the possibility of fewer pipeline miles going over
the aquifer system and avoiding completely environmentally fragile
areas. It indicated that pipeline construction would not harm \"most
resources\".

As noted at the outset of this chapter, the Obama Administration
declined to approve construction of the Keystone XL project. However,
the Trump administration announced its willingness to do so, but as
noted earlier, the Biden administration effectively ended the project.
While we may fairly easily quantify the economic benefits of additional
oil in the United States, the social costs are more challenging to
measure. Consequently, different observers may reach different
conclusions about the balance between estimates of economic benefits and
estimates of the social costs of the pipeline project.
