## 16.1 The Problem of Imperfect Information and Asymmetric Information

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

-   Analyze the impact of both imperfect information and asymmetric
    information
-   Evaluate the role of advertisements in creating imperfect
    information
-   Identify ways to reduce the risk of imperfect information
-   Explain how imperfect information can affect price, quantity, and
    quality

Consider a purchase that many people make at important times in their
lives: buying expensive jewelry. In May 1994, celebrity psychologist
Doree Lynn bought an expensive ring from a jeweler in Washington, D.C.,
which included an emerald that cost \$14,500. Several years later, the
emerald fractured. Lynn took it to another jeweler who found that cracks
in the emerald had been filled with an epoxy resin. Lynn sued the
original jeweler in 1997 for selling her a treated emerald without
telling her, and won. The case publicized a number of little-known facts
about precious stones. Most emeralds have internal flaws, and so they
are soaked in clear oil or an epoxy resin to hide the flaws and make the
color more deep and clear. Clear oil can leak out over time, and epoxy
resin can discolor with age or heat. However, using clear oil or epoxy
to "fill" emeralds is completely legal, as long as it is disclosed.

After Doree Lynn's lawsuit, the NBC news show "Dateline" bought emeralds
at four prominent jewelry stores in New York City in 1997. All the sales
clerks at these stores, unaware that they were being recorded on a
hidden camera, said the stones were untreated. When the emeralds were
tested at a laboratory, however, technicians discovered they had all
been treated with oil or epoxy. Emeralds are not the only gemstones that
are treated. Diamonds, topaz, and tourmaline are also often irradiated
to enhance colors. The general rule is that all treatments to gemstones
should be revealed, but often sellers do not disclose this. As such,
many buyers face a situation of asymmetric information, where two
parties involved in an economic transaction have an unequal amount of
information (one party knows much more than the other).

Many economic transactions occur in a situation of imperfect
information, where either the buyer, the seller, or both, are less than
100% certain about the qualities of what they are buying and selling.
Also, one may characterize the transaction as asymmetric information, in
which one party has more information than the other regarding the
economic transaction. Let's begin with some examples of how imperfect
information complicates transactions in goods, labor, and financial
capital markets. The presence of imperfect information can easily cause
a decline in prices or quantities of products sold. However, buyers and
sellers also have incentives to create mechanisms that will allow them
to make mutually beneficial transactions even in the face of imperfect
information.

If you are unclear about the difference between asymmetric information
and imperfect information, read the following Clear It Up feature.

### Clear It Up {#clear-it-up .Heading3Grey}

#### What is the difference between imperfect and asymmetric information? {#what-is-the-difference-between-imperfect-and-asymmetric-information .Heading4Grey}

For a market to reach equilibrium sellers and buyers must have full
information about the product's price and quality. If there is limited
information, then buyers and sellers may not be able to transact or will
possibly make poor decisions.

Imperfect information refers to the situation where buyers and/or
sellers do not have all of the necessary information to make an informed
decision about the product\'s price or quality. The term imperfect
information simply means that the buyers and/or sellers do not have all
the information necessary to make an informed decision. Asymmetric
information is the condition where one party, either the buyer or the
seller, has more information about the product\'s quality or price than
the other party. In either case (imperfect or asymmetric information)
buyers or sellers need remedies to make more informed decisions.

### "Lemons" and Other Examples of Imperfect Information

Consider Marvin, who is trying to decide whether to buy a used car.
Let's assume that Marvin is truly clueless about what happens inside a
car's engine. He is willing to do some background research, like reading
*Consumer Reports* or checking websites that offer information about
used car makes and models and what they should cost. He might pay a
mechanic to inspect the car. Even after devoting some money and time
collecting information, however, Marvin still cannot be absolutely sure
that he is buying a high-quality used car. He knows that he might buy
the car, drive it home, and use it for a few weeks before discovering
that car is a "lemon," which is slang for a defective product
(especially a car).

Imagine that Marvin shops for a used car and finds two that look very
similar in terms of mileage, exterior appearances, and age. One car
costs \$4,000, while the other car costs \$4,600. Which car should
Marvin buy?

If Marvin were choosing in a world of perfect information, the answer
would be simple: he should buy the cheaper car. However, Marvin is
operating in a world of imperfect information, where the sellers likely
know more about the car's problems than he does, and have an incentive
to hide the information. After all, the more problems the sellers
disclose, the lower the car's selling price.

What should Marvin do? First, he needs to understand that even with
imperfect information, prices still reflect information. Typically, used
cars are more expensive on some dealer lots because the dealers have a
trustworthy reputation to uphold. Those dealers try to fix problems that
may not be obvious to their customers, in order to create good word of
mouth about their vehicles' long term reliability. The short term
benefits of selling their customers a "lemon" could cause a quick
collapse in the dealer's reputation and a loss of long term profits. On
other lots that are less well-established, one can find cheaper used
cars, but the buyer takes on more risk when a dealer's reputation has
little at stake. The cheapest cars of all often appear on Craigslist,
where the individual seller has no reputation to defend. In sum, cheaper
prices do carry more risk, so Marvin should balance his appetite for
risk versus the potential headaches of many more unanticipated trips to
the repair shop.

Similar problems with imperfect information arise in labor and financial
capital markets. Consider Greta, who is applying for a job. Her
potential employer, like the used car buyer, is concerned about ending
up with a "lemon"---in this case a poor quality employee. The employer
will collect information about Greta's academic and work history. In the
end, however, a degree of uncertainty will inevitably remain regarding
Greta's abilities, which are hard to demonstrate without actually
observing her on the job. How can a potential employer screen for
certain attributes, such as motivation, timeliness, and ability to get
along with others? Employers often look to trade schools and colleges to
pre-screen candidates. Employers may not even interview a candidate
unless he has a degree and, sometimes, a degree from a particular
school. Employers may also view awards, a high grade point average, and
other accolades as a signal of hard work, perseverance, and ability.
Employers may also seek references for insights into key attributes such
as energy level and work ethic.

### How Imperfect Information Can Affect Equilibrium Price and Quantity

The presence of imperfect information can discourage both buyers and
sellers from participating in the market. Buyers may become reluctant to
participate because they cannot determine the product\'s quality.
Sellers of high-quality or medium-quality goods may be reluctant to
participate, because it is difficult to demonstrate the quality of their
goods to buyers---and since buyers cannot determine which goods have
higher quality, they are likely to be unwilling to pay a higher price
for such goods.

Economists sometimes refer to a market with few buyers and few sellers
as a thin market. By contrast, they call a market with many buyers and
sellers a thick market. When imperfect information is severe and buyers
and sellers are discouraged from participating, markets may become
extremely thin as a relatively small number of buyer and sellers attempt
to communicate enough information that they can agree on a price.

### When Price Mixes with Imperfect Information about Quality

A buyer confronted with imperfect information will often believe that
the price reveals something about the product\'s quality. For example, a
buyer may assume that a gemstone or a used car that costs more must be
of higher quality, even though the buyer is not an expert on gemstones.
Think of the expensive restaurant where the food must be good because it
is so expensive or the shop where the clothes must be stylish because
they cost so much, or the gallery where the art must be great, because
the price tags are high. If you are hiring a lawyer, you might assume
that a lawyer who charges \$400 per hour must be better than a lawyer
who charges \$150 per hour. In these cases, price can act as a signal of
quality.

When buyers use the market price to draw inferences about the products\'
quality, then markets may have trouble reaching an equilibrium price and
quantity. Imagine a situation where a used car dealer has a lot full of
used cars that do not seem to be selling, and so the dealer decides to
cut the car prices to sell a greater quantity. In a market with
imperfect information, many buyers may assume that the lower price
implies low-quality cars. As a result, the lower price may not attract
more customers. Conversely, a dealer who raises prices may find that
customers assume that the higher price means that cars are of higher
quality. As a result of raising prices, the dealer might sell more cars.
(Whether or not consumers always behave rationally, as an economist
would see it, is the subject of the following Clear It Up feature.)

The idea that higher prices might cause a greater quantity demanded and
that lower prices might cause a lower quantity demanded runs exactly
counter to the basic model of demand and supply (as we outlined in the
[Demand and
Supply](http://openstax.org/books/principles-microeconomics-3e/pages/3-introduction-to-demand-and-supply)
chapter). These contrary effects, however, will reach natural limits. At
some point, if the price is high enough, the quantity demanded will
decline. Conversely, when the price declines far enough, buyers will
increasingly find value even if the quality is lower. In addition,
information eventually becomes more widely known. An overpriced
restaurant that charges more than the quality of its food is worth to
many buyers will not last forever.

### Clear It Up {#clear-it-up-1 .Heading3Grey}

#### Is consumer behavior rational? {#is-consumer-behavior-rational .Heading4Grey}

There is much human behavior that mainstream economists have tended to
call "irrational" since it is consistently at odds with economists'
utility maximizing models. The typical response is for economists to
brush these behaviors aside and call them "anomalies" or unexplained
quirks.

"If only you knew more economics, you would not be so irrational," is
what many mainstream economists seem to be saying. A group known as
behavioral economists has challenged this notion, because so much of
this so-called "quirky" behavior is extremely common among us. For
example, a conventional economist would say that if you lost a \$10 bill
today, and also received an extra \$10 in your paycheck, you should feel
perfectly neutral. After all, --\$10 + \$10 = \$0. You are the same
financially as you were before. However, behavioral economists have
conducted research that shows many people will feel some negative
emotion---anger or frustration---after those two things happen. We tend
to focus more on the loss than the gain. Economists Daniel Kahneman and
Amos Tversky in a famous 1979 *Econometrica* paper called this \"loss
aversion\", where a \$1 loss pains us 2.25 times more than a \$1 gain
helps us. This has implications for investing, as people tend to
"overplay" the stock market by reacting more to losses than to gains.

Behavioral economics also tries to explain why people make seemingly
irrational decisions in the presence of different situations, or how
they \"frame\" the decision. We outline a popular example here: Imagine
you have the opportunity to buy an alarm clock for \$20 in Store A.
Across the street, you learn, is the exact same clock at Store B for
\$10. You might say it is worth your time---a five-minute walk---to save
\$10. Now, take a different example: You are in Store A buying a \$300
phone. Five minutes away, at Store B, the same phone is \$290. You again
save \$10 by taking a five-minute walk. Do you do it?

Surprisingly, it is likely that you would not. Mainstream economists
would say "\$10 is \$10" and that it would be irrational to make a five
minute walk for \$10 in one case and not the other. However, behavioral
economists have pointed out that most of us evaluate outcomes relative
to a reference point---here the cost of the product---and think of gains
and losses as percentages rather than using actual savings.

Which view is right? Both have their advantages, but behavioral
economists have at least shed a light on trying to describe and explain
systematic behavior which some previously had dismissed as irrational.
If most of us are engaged in some "irrational behavior," perhaps there
are deeper underlying reasons for this behavior in the first place.

### Mechanisms to Reduce the Risk of Imperfect Information

If you were selling a good like emeralds or used cars where imperfect
information is likely to be a problem, how could you reassure possible
buyers? If you were buying a good where imperfect information is a
problem, what would it take to reassure you? Buyers and sellers in the
goods market rely on reputation as well as guarantees, warrantees, and
service contracts to assure product quality. The labor market uses
occupational licenses and certifications to assure competency, while the
financial capital market uses cosigners and collateral as insurance
against unforeseen, detrimental events.

In the goods market, the seller might offer a money-back guarantee, an
agreement that functions as a promise of quality. This strategy may be
especially important for a company that sells goods through mail-order
catalogs or over the web, whose customers cannot see the actual
products, because it encourages people to buy something even if they are
not certain they want to keep it.

L.L. Bean started using money-back-guarantees in 1911, when the founder
stitched waterproof shoe rubbers together with leather shoe tops, and
sold them as hunting shoes. He guaranteed satisfaction. However, the
stitching came apart and, out of the first batch of 100 pairs that were
sold, customers returned 90 pairs. L.L. Bean took out a bank loan,
repaired all of the shoes, and replaced them. The L.L. Bean reputation
for customer satisfaction began to spread. Many firms today offer
money-back-guarantees for a few weeks or months, but L.L. Bean offers a
complete money-back guarantee. Customers can always return anything they
have bought from L.L. Bean, no matter how many years later or what
condition the product is in, for a full money-back guarantee.

L.L. Bean has very few stores. Instead, most of its sales are made by
mail, telephone, or, now, through their website. For this kind of firm,
imperfect information may be an especially difficult problem, because
customers cannot see and touch what they are buying. A combination of a
money-back guarantee and a reputation for quality can help for a
mail-order firm to flourish.

Sellers may offer a warranty, which is a promise to fix or replace the
good, at least for a certain time period. The seller may also offer a
buyer a chance to buy a service contract, where the buyer pays an extra
amount and the seller agrees to fix anything that goes wrong for a set
time period. Service contracts are often an option for buyers of large
purchases such as cars, appliances and even houses.

Guarantees, warranties, and service contracts are examples of explicit
reassurance that sellers provide. In many cases, firms also offer
unstated guarantees. For example, some movie theaters might refund the
ticket cost to a customer who walks out complaining about the show.
Likewise, while restaurants do not generally advertise a money-back
guarantee or exchange policies, many restaurants allow customers to
exchange one dish for another or reduce the price of the bill if the
customer is not satisfied.

The rationale for these policies is that firms want repeat customers,
who in turn will recommend the business to others. As such, establishing
a good reputation is of paramount importance. When buyers know that a
firm is concerned about its reputation, they are less likely to worry
about receiving a poor-quality product. For example, a well-established
grocery store with a good reputation can often charge a higher price
than a temporary stand at a local farmer's market, where the buyer may
never see the seller again.

Sellers of labor provide information through resumes, recommendations,
school transcripts, and examples of their work. The labor market also
uses occupational licenses to establish quality in the labor market.
Occupational licenses, which government agencies typically issue, show
that a worker has completed a certain type of education or passed a
certain test. Some of the professionals who must hold a license are
doctors, teachers, nurses, engineers, accountants, and lawyers. In
addition, most states require a license to work as a barber, an
embalmer, a dietitian, a massage therapist, a hearing aid dealer, a
counselor, an insurance agent, and a real estate broker. Some other jobs
require a license in only one state. Minnesota requires a state license
to be a field archaeologist. North Dakota has a state license for bait
retailers. In Louisiana, one needs a state license to be a "stress
analyst" and California requires a state license to be a furniture
upholsterer. According to a 2013 study from the University of Chicago,
about 29% of U.S. workers have jobs that require occupational licenses.

Occupational licenses have their downside as well, as they represent a
barrier to entry to certain industries. This makes it more difficult for
new entrants to compete with incumbents, which can lead to higher prices
and less consumer choice. In occupations that require licenses, the
government has decided that the additional information provided by
licenses outweighs the negative effect on competition.

### Clear It Up {#clear-it-up-2 .Heading3Grey}

#### Are advertisers allowed to benefit from imperfect information? {#are-advertisers-allowed-to-benefit-from-imperfect-information .Heading4Grey}

Many advertisements seem full of imperfect information---at least by
what they imply. Driving a certain car, drinking a particular soda, or
wearing a certain shoe are all unlikely to bring fashionable friends and
fun automatically, if at all. The government rules on advertising,
enforced by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), allow advertising to
contain a certain amount of exaggeration about the general delight of
using a product. They, however, also demand that if one presents a claim
as a fact, it must be true.

Legally, deceptive advertising dates back to the 1950s when
Colgate-Palmolive created a television advertisement that seemed to show
Rapid Shave shaving cream being spread on sandpaper and then the sand
was shaved off the sandpaper. What the television advertisement actually
showed was sand sprinkled on Plexiglas---without glue---and then scraped
aside by the razor.

In the 1960s, in magazine advertisements for Campbell's vegetable soup,
the company was having problems getting an appetizing soup picture,
because the vegetables kept sinking. To remedy this, they filled a bowl
with marbles and poured the soup over the top, so that the bowl appeared
to be crammed with vegetables.

In the late 1980s, the Volvo Company filmed a television advertisement
that showed a monster truck driving over cars, crunching their
roofs---all except for the Volvo, which did not crush. However, the FTC
found in 1991 that the Volvo\'s roof from the filming had been
reinforced with an extra steel framework, while they cut the roof
supports on the other car brands.

The Wonder Bread Company ran television advertisements featuring
"Professor Wonder," who said that because Wonder Bread contained extra
calcium, it would help children's minds work better and improve their
memory. The FTC objected, and in 2002 the company agreed to stop running
the advertisements.

As we can see in each of these cases, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)
often checks factual claims about the product's performance, at least to
some extent. Language and images that are exaggerated or ambiguous, but
not actually false, are allowed in advertising. Untrue "facts" are not
permitted. In any case, an old Latin saying applies when watching
advertisements: *Caveat emptor*---that is, "let the buyer beware."

On the buyer's side of the labor market, a standard precaution against
hiring a "lemon" of an employee is to specify that the first few months
of employment are officially a trial or probationary period, and that
the employer can dismiss the worker for any reason or no reason during
that time. Sometimes workers also receive lower pay during this trial
period.

In the financial capital market, before a bank makes a loan, it requires
a prospective borrower to fill out forms regarding incomes sources. In
addition, the bank conducts a credit check on the individual's past
borrowing. Another approach is to require a cosigner on a loan; that is,
another person or firm who legally pledges to repay some or all of the
money if the original borrower does not do so. Another approach is to
require collateral, often property or equipment that the bank would have
a right to seize and sell if borrower does not repay the loan.

Buyers of goods and services cannot possibly become experts in
evaluating the quality of gemstones, used cars, lawyers, and everything
else they buy. Employers and lenders cannot be perfectly omniscient
about whether possible workers will turn out well or potential borrowers
will repay loans on time. However, the mechanisms that we mentioned
above can reduce the risks associated with imperfect information so that
the buyer and seller are willing to proceed.
