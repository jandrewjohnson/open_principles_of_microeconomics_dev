Susan is a single mother with three children. She can earn \$8 per hour
and works up to 1,800 hours per year. However, if she does not earn any
income at all, she will receive government benefits totaling \$16,000
per year. For every \$1 of income she earns, her level of government
support will be reduced by \$1. Create a table, patterned after [this
one](http://openstax.org/books/principles-microeconomics-3e/pages/chapter-15#ch14mod02_tab06).
The first column should show Susan's choices of how many hours to work
per year, up to 1,800 hours. The second column should show her earnings
from work. The third column should show her level of government support,
given her earnings. The final column should show her total income,
combining earnings and government support. Based on the table you
created, what are the likely impacts of this kind of assistance program
on Susan\'s incentive to work? Are there additional opportunity costs
that may reduce her incentive to work?

A group of 10 people have the following annual incomes: \$55,000,
\$30,000, \$15,000, \$20,000, \$35,000, \$80,000, \$40,000, \$45,000,
\$30,000, \$50,000. Calculate the share of total income each quintile of
this income distribution received. Do the top and bottom quintiles in
this distribution have a greater or larger share of total income than
the top and bottom quintiles of the U.S. income distribution for 2005?
