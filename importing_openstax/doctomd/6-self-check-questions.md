Jeremy is deeply in love with Jasmine. Jasmine lives where cell phone
coverage is poor, so he can either call her on the land-line phone for
five cents per minute or he can drive to see her, at a round-trip cost
of \$2 in gasoline money. He has a total of \$10 per week to spend on
staying in touch. To make his preferred choice, Jeremy uses a handy
utilimometer that measures his total utility from personal visits and
from phone minutes. Using the values in [Table 6.6](#Table_06_06),
figure out the points on Jeremy's consumption choice budget constraint
(it may be helpful to do a sketch) and identify his utility-maximizing
point.

utility.

of goods?
