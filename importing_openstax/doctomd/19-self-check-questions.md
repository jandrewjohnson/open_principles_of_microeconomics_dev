True or False: The source of comparative advantage must be natural
elements like climate and mineral deposits. Explain.

Brazil can produce 100 pounds of beef or 10 autos. In contrast the
United States can produce 40 pounds of beef or 30 autos. Which country
has the absolute advantage in beef? Which country has the absolute
advantage in producing autos? What is the opportunity cost of producing
one pound of beef in Brazil? What is the opportunity cost of producing
one pound of beef in the United States?

In France it takes one worker to produce one sweater, and one worker to
produce one bottle of wine. In Tunisia it takes two workers to produce
one sweater, and three workers to produce one bottle of wine. Who has
the absolute advantage in production of sweaters? Who has the absolute
advantage in the production of wine? How can you tell?

In Germany it takes three workers to make one television and four
workers to make one video camera. In Poland it takes six workers to make
one television and 12 workers to make one video camera.

a.  Who has the absolute advantage in the production of televisions? Who
    has the absolute advantage in the production of video cameras? How
    can you tell?
b.  Calculate the opportunity cost of producing one additional
    television set in Germany and in Poland. (Your calculation may
    involve fractions, which is fine.) Which country has a comparative
    advantage in the production of televisions?
c.  Calculate the opportunity cost of producing one video camera in
    Germany and in Poland. Which country has a comparative advantage in
    the production of video cameras?
d.  In this example, is absolute advantage the same as comparative
    advantage, or not?
e.  In what product should Germany specialize? In what product should
    Poland specialize?

How can there be any economic gains for a country from both importing
and exporting the same good, like cars?

[Table 19.15](#Table_33_16) shows how the average costs of production
for semiconductors (the "chips" in computer memories) change as the
quantity of semiconductors built at that factory increases.

a.  Based on these data, sketch a curve with quantity produced on the
    horizontal axis and average cost of production on the vertical axis.
    How does the curve illustrate economies of scale?
b.  If the equilibrium quantity of semiconductors demanded is 90,000,
    can this economy take full advantage of economies of scale? What
    about if quantity demanded is 70,000 semiconductors? 50,000
    semiconductors? 30,000 semiconductors?
c.  Explain how international trade could make it possible for even a
    small economy to take full advantage of economies of scale, while
    also benefiting from competition and the variety offered by several
    producers.

If the removal of trade barriers is so beneficial to international
economic growth, why would a nation continue to restrict trade on some
imported or exported products?
