During a discussion several years ago on building a pipeline to Alaska
to carry natural gas, the U.S. Senate passed a bill stipulating that
there should be a guaranteed minimum price for the natural gas that
would flow through the pipeline. The thinking behind the bill was that
if private firms had a guaranteed price for their natural gas, they
would be more willing to drill for gas and to pay to build the pipeline.

a.  Using the demand and supply framework, predict the effects of this
    price floor on the price, quantity demanded, and quantity supplied.
b.  With the enactment of this price floor for natural gas, what are
    some of the likely unintended consequences in the market?
c.  Suggest some policies other than the price floor that the government
    can pursue if it wishes to encourage drilling for natural gas and
    for a new pipeline in Alaska.
