## Problems

29\.

France and Tunisia both have Mediterranean climates that are excellent
for producing/harvesting green beans and tomatoes. In France it takes
two hours for each worker to harvest green beans and two hours to
harvest a tomato. Tunisian workers need only one hour to harvest the
tomatoes but four hours to harvest green beans. Assume there are only
two workers, one in each country, and each works 40 hours a week.

a.  Draw a production possibilities frontier for each country. *Hint*:
    Remember the production possibility frontier is the maximum that all
    workers can produce at a unit of time which, in this problem, is a
    week.
b.  Identify which country has the absolute advantage in green beans and
    which country has the absolute advantage in tomatoes.
c.  Identify which country has the comparative advantage.
d.  How much would France have to give up in terms of tomatoes to gain
    from trade? How much would it have to give up in terms of green
    beans?

In Japan, one worker can make 5 tons of rubber or 80 radios. In
Malaysia, one worker can make 10 tons of rubber or 40 radios.

a.  Who has the absolute advantage in the production of rubber or
    radios? How can you tell?
b.  Calculate the opportunity cost of producing 80 additional radios in
    Japan and in Malaysia. (Your calculation may involve fractions,
    which is fine.) Which country has a comparative advantage in the
    production of radios?
c.  Calculate the opportunity cost of producing 10 additional tons of
    rubber in Japan and in Malaysia. Which country has a comparative
    advantage in producing rubber?
d.  In this example, does each country have an absolute advantage and a
    comparative advantage in the same good?
e.  In what product should Japan specialize? In what product should
    Malaysia specialize?

Review the numbers for Canada and Venezuela from [Table
19.12](http://openstax.org/books/principles-microeconomics-3e/pages/19-2-what-happens-when-a-country-has-an-absolute-advantage-in-all-goods#Table_33_13)
which describes how many barrels of oil and tons of lumber the workers
can produce. Use these numbers to answer the rest of this question.

a.  Draw a production possibilities frontier for each country. Assume
    there are 100 workers in each country. Canadians and Venezuelans
    desire both oil and lumber. Canadians want at least 2,000 tons of
    lumber. Mark a point on their production possibilities where they
    can get at least 3,000 tons.
b.  Assume that the Canadians specialize completely because they figured
    out they have a comparative advantage in lumber. They are willing to
    give up 1,000 tons of lumber. How much oil should they ask for in
    return for this lumber to be as well off as they were with no trade?
    How much should they ask for if they want to gain from trading with
    Venezuela? *Note*: We can think of this "ask" as the relative price
    or trade price of lumber.
c.  Is the Canadian "ask" you identified in (b) also beneficial for
    Venezuelans? Use the production possibilities frontier graph for
    Venezuela to show that Venezuelans can gain from trade.

32\.

In [Exercise 19.31](#fs-idm129993648), is there an "ask" where
Venezuelans may say "no thank you" to trading with Canada?

33\.

From earlier chapters you will recall that technological change shifts
the average cost curves. Draw a graph showing how technological change
could influence intra-industry trade.

34\.

Consider two countries: South Korea and Taiwan. Taiwan can produce one
million mobile phones per day at the cost of \$10 per phone and South
Korea can produce 50 million mobile phones at \$5 per phone. Assume
these phones are the same type and quality and there is only one price.
What is the minimum price at which both countries will engage in trade?

35\.

If trade increases world GDP by 1% per year, what is the global impact
of this increase over 10 years? How does this increase compare to the
annual GDP of a country like Sri Lanka? Discuss. *Hint*: To answer this
question, here are steps you may want to consider. Go to the World
Development Indicators (online) published by the World Bank. Find the
current level of World GDP in constant international dollars. Also, find
the GDP of Sri Lanka in constant international dollars. Once you have
these two numbers, compute the amount the additional increase in global
incomes due to trade and compare that number to Sri Lanka's GDP.
