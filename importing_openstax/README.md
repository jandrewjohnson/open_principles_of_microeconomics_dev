# Scripts Run Order

We firstly need to run the following Python Script to have the chapters from 1-20 almost done. Make sure you run the scripts in the following order.

- preparemarkdown.py
- image_ref_fix.py
- mdtoqmd.py
- combine_chapters.py
- add_title.py
- clean_mathequationtitle.py

---

Then I manually fix the tables, and delete some unused math equation links.
