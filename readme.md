# Open Principles of Microeconomics

This repository generates the book Open Principles of Microeconomics. Currently, the book draws almost exclusively from the OpenStax.org Open Educational Resource (OER) [Principles of Microeconomics, 3rd Edition (Shapiro, MacDonald and Greenlaw, 2023)](https://openstax.org/details/books/principles-microeconomics-3e). In 2024, the book will undergo extensive updating as a part of APEC 1101, Principles of Microeconomics, taught by Justin Johnson in Applied Economics at the University of Minneosta.

## Building the book

The input files from OpenStax.org were converted from Docx to Quarto QMD files. This enables dynamic generation of book content, including Python-created images. To render the book from QMD to HTML, run the scripts/render_all.py. Currently, these HTML files are hosted on Justin Johnson's personal website, though they can of course be accessed directly through GitHub.
