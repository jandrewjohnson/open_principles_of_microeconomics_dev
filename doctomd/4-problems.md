    increases.
b.  People gain confidence that the economy is growing and that their

c.  Banks that have made home loans find that a larger number of people

[Table 4.6](#Table_04_06) shows the amount of savings and borrowing in a
market for loans to purchase homes, measured in millions of dollars, at
various interest rates. What is the equilibrium interest rate and
quantity in the capital financial market? How can you tell? Now, imagine
that because of a shift in the perceptions of foreign investors, the
supply curve shifts so that there will be \$10 million less supplied at
every interest rate. Calculate the new equilibrium interest rate and
quantity, and explain why the direction of the interest rate shift makes
intuitive sense.

Imagine that to preserve the traditional way of life in small fishing

    price, quantity demanded, and quantity supplied.
b.  With the enactment of this price floor for fish, what are some of
    the likely unintended consequences in the market?
c.  Suggest some policies other than the price floor to make it possible
    for small fishing villages to continue.
