again. Suppose the price of gasoline is \$1.00. Will the quantity
demanded be lower or higher than at the equilibrium price of \$1.40 per
gallon? Will the quantity supplied be lower or higher? Is there a
shortage or a surplus in the market? If so, of how much?

[Table 3.8](#Table_03_06) shows information on the demand and supply for
bicycles, where the quantities of bicycles are measured in thousands.

Table 3.8

a.  What is the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied at a price
    of \$210?
b.  At what price is the quantity supplied equal to 48,000?
c.  Graph the demand and supply curve for bicycles. How can you
    determine the equilibrium price and quantity from the graph? How can
    you determine the equilibrium price and quantity from the table?
    What are the equilibrium price and equilibrium quantity?
d.  If the price was \$120, what would the quantities demanded and
    supplied be? Would a shortage or surplus exist? If so, how large
    would the shortage or surplus be?

The computer market in recent years has seen many more computers sell at
much lower prices. What shift in demand or supply is most likely to
explain this outcome? Sketch a demand and supply diagram and explain
your reasoning for each.

a.  A rise in demand
b.  A fall in demand
c.  A rise in supply
d.  A fall in supply

[Table 3.9](#Table_03_08) illustrates the market\'s demand and supply
for cheddar cheese. Graph the data and find the equilibrium. Next,
create a table showing the change in quantity demanded or quantity
supplied, and a graph of the new equilibrium, in each of the following
situations:

a.  The price of milk, a key input for cheese production, rises, so that
    the supply decreases by 80 pounds at every price.
b.  A new study says that eating cheese is good for your health, so that
    demand increases by 20% at every price.

[Table 3.10](#Table_03_09) shows the supply and demand for movie tickets
in a city. Graph demand and supply and identify the equilibrium. Then
calculate in a table and graph the effect of the following two changes.

a.  Three new nightclubs open. They offer decent bands and have no cover
    charge, but make their money by selling food and drink. As a result,
    demand for movie tickets falls by six units at every price.
b.  The city eliminates a tax that it placed on all local entertainment
    businesses. The result is that the quantity supplied of movies at
    any given price increases by 10%.

A low-income country decides to set a price ceiling on bread so it can
make sure that bread is affordable to the poor. [Table
3.11](#Table_03_11) provides the conditions of demand and supply. What
are the equilibrium price and equilibrium quantity before the price
ceiling? What will the excess demand or the shortage (that is, quantity
demanded minus quantity supplied) be if the price ceiling is set at
\$2.40? At \$2.00? At \$3.60?
