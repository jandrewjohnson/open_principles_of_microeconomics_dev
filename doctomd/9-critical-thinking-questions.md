## Critical Thinking Questions

25\.

ALCOA does not have the monopoly power it once had. How do you suppose
their barriers to entry were weakened?

26\.

Why are generic pharmaceuticals significantly cheaper than name brand
ones?

27\.

For many years, the Justice Department has tried to break up large firms
like IBM, Microsoft, and most recently Google, on the grounds that their
large market share made them essentially monopolies. In a global market,
where U.S. firms compete with firms from other countries, would this
policy make the same sense as it might in a purely domestic context?

28\.

Intellectual property laws are intended to promote innovation, but some
economists, such as Milton Friedman, have argued that such laws are not
desirable. In the United States, there is no intellectual property
protection for food recipes or for fashion designs. Considering the
state of these two industries, and bearing in mind the discussion of the
inefficiency of monopolies, can you think of any reasons why
intellectual property laws might hinder innovation in some cases?

29\.

Imagine that you are managing a small firm and thinking about entering
the market of a monopolist. The monopolist is currently charging a high
price, and you have calculated that you can make a nice profit charging
10% less than the monopolist. Before you go ahead and challenge the
monopolist, what possibility should you consider for how the monopolist
might react?

30\.

If a monopoly firm is earning profits, how much would you expect these
profits to be diminished by entry in the long run?
