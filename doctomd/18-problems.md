Say that the government is considering a ban on smoking in restaurants
in Tobaccoville. There are 1 million people living there, and each would
benefit by \$200 from this smoking ban. However, there are two large
tobacco companies in Tobaccoville and the ban would cost them \$5
million each. What are the proposed policy\'s total costs and benefits?
Do you think it will pass?
