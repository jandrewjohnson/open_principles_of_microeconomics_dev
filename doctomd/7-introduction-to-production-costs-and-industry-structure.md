company that sells books, among many other things, shipping them
directly to the consumer. Until recently there were no brick and mortar
Amazon stores. (Credit: modification of "Amazon Prime Delivery Van

## Introduction to Production, Costs, and Industry Structure

### Bring It Home {#bring-it-home .Heading3Grey}

#### Amazon {#amazon .Heading4Grey}

In less than two decades, Amazon.com has transformed the way consumers
sell, buy, and even read. Prior to Amazon, independent bookstores with
limited inventories in small retail locations primarily sold books.
There were exceptions, of course. Borders and Barnes & Noble offered
larger stores in urban areas. In the last decade, however, independent
bookstores have mostly disappeared, Borders has gone out of business,
and Barnes & Noble is struggling. Online delivery and purchase of books
has overtaken the more traditional business models. How has Amazon
changed the book selling industry? How has it managed to crush its
competition?

A major reason for the giant retailer's success is its production model
and cost structure, which has enabled Amazon to undercut the
competitors\' prices even when factoring in the cost of shipping. Read
on to see how firms great (like Amazon) and small (like your corner
deli) determine what to sell, at what output, and price.

This chapter is the first of four chapters that explores the *theory of
the firm*. This theory explains how firms behave. What does that mean?
Let's define what we mean by the firm. A firm (or producer or business)
combines inputs of labor, capital, land, and raw or finished component
materials to produce outputs. If the firm is successful, the outputs are
more valuable than the inputs. This activity of production goes beyond
manufacturing (i.e., making things). It includes any process or service
that creates value, including transportation, distribution, wholesale
and retail sales.

Production involves a number of important decisions that define a
firm\'s behavior. These decisions include, but are not limited to:

-   What product or products should the firm produce?
-   How should the firm produce the products (i.e., what production
    process should the firm use)?
-   How much output should the firm produce?
-   What price should the firm charge for its products?
-   How much labor should the firm employ?

The answers to these questions depend on the production and cost
conditions facing each firm. That is the subject of this chapter. The
answers also depend on the market structure for the product(s) in
question. Market structure is a multidimensional concept that involves
how competitive the industry is. We define it by questions such as
these:

-   How much market power does each firm in the industry possess?
-   How similar is each firm's product to the products of other firms in
    the industry?
-   How difficult is it for new firms to enter the industry?
-   Do firms compete on the basis of price, advertising, or other
    product differences?

[Figure 7.2](#CNX_Econ_C07_001) illustrates the range of different
market structures, which we will explore in [Perfect
Competition](http://openstax.org/books/principles-microeconomics-3e/pages/8-introduction-to-perfect-competition),
[Monopoly](http://openstax.org/books/principles-microeconomics-3e/pages/9-introduction-to-a-monopoly),
and [Monopolistic Competition and
Oligopoly](http://openstax.org/books/principles-microeconomics-3e/pages/10-introduction-to-monopolistic-competition-and-oligopoly).

Figure 7.2 The Spectrum of Competition Firms face different competitive
situations. At one extreme---perfect competition---many firms are all
trying to sell identical products. At the other
extreme---monopoly---only one firm is selling the product, and this firm
faces no competition. Monopolistic competition and oligopoly fall
between the extremes of perfect competition and monopoly. Monopolistic
competition is a situation with many firms selling similar, but not
identical products. Oligopoly is a situation with few firms that sell
identical or similar products.

Let\'s examine how firms determine their costs and desired profit
levels. Then we will discuss the origins of cost, both in the short and
long run. Private enterprise, which can be private individual or group
business ownership, characterizes the U.S. economy. In the U.S. system,
we have the option to organize private businesses as sole
proprietorships (one owner), partners (more than one owner), and
corporations (legal entitles separate from the owners.

When people think of businesses, often corporate giants like Wal-Mart,
Microsoft, or General Motors come to mind. However, firms come in all
sizes, as [Table 7.1](#Table_07_01) shows. The vast majority of American
firms have fewer than 20 employees. As of 2010, the U.S. Census Bureau
counted 5.7 million firms with employees in the U.S. economy. Slightly
less than half of all the workers in private firms are at the 17,000
large firms, meaning they employ more than 500 workers. Another 35% of
workers in the U.S. economy are at firms with fewer than 100 workers.
These small-scale businesses include everything from dentists and
lawyers to businesses that mow lawns or clean houses. [Table
7.1](#Table_07_01) does not include a separate category for the millions
of small "non-employer" businesses where a single owner or a few
partners are not officially paid wages or a salary, but simply receive
whatever they can earn.
