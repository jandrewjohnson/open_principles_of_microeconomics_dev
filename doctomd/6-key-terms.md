## Key Terms

behavioral economics

:   a branch of economics that seeks to enrich the understanding of
    decision-making by integrating the insights of psychology and by
    investigating how given dollar amounts can mean different things to
    individuals depending on the situation

budget constraint (or budget line)

:   shows the possible combinations of two goods that are affordable
    given a consumer's limited income

consumer equilibrium

:   point on the budget line where the consumer gets the most
    satisfaction; this occurs when the ratio of the prices of goods is
    equal to the ratio of the marginal utilities.

diminishing marginal utility

:   the common pattern that each marginal unit of a good consumed
    provides less of an addition to utility than the previous unit

fungible

:   the idea that units of a good, such as dollars, ounces of gold, or
    barrels of oil are capable of mutual substitution with each other
    and carry equal value to the individual

income effect

:   a higher price means that, in effect, the buying power of income has
    been reduced, even though actual income has not changed; always
    happens simultaneously with a substitution effect

marginal utility

:   the additional utility provided by one additional unit of
    consumption

marginal utility per dollar

:   the additional satisfaction gained from purchasing a good given the
    price of the product; MU/Price

substitution effect

:   when a price changes, consumers have an incentive to consume less of
    the good with a relatively higher price and more of the good with a
    relatively lower price; always happens simultaneously with an income
    effect

total utility

:   satisfaction derived from consumer choices
