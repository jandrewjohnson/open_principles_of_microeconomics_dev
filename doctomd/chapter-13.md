No. A market demand curve reflects only the private benefits of those
who are consuming the product. Positive externalities are benefits that
spill over to third parties, so they create social benefits, and are not
captured by a market (or private benefit) demand curve.

Clearly Samsung is benefiting from the investment, so the 20% increase
in profits is a private benefit. If Samsung is unable to capture all of
the benefit, perhaps because other companies quickly copy and produce
close substitutes, then Samsung's investment will produce social
benefits.

a.  \$102 million.
b.  If the interest rate is 9%, the cost of financial capital, and the
    firm can capture the 5% return to society, the firm would invest as
    if its effective rate of return is 4%, so it will invest \$183
    million.

When the Junkbuyers Company purchases something for resale, presumably
both the buyer and the seller benefit---otherwise, they would not need
to make the transaction. However, the company also reduces the amount of
garbage produced, which saves money for households and/or for the city
that disposes of garbage. So the social benefits are larger than the
private benefits.

Government programs that either pay for neighborhood clean-up directly
or that provide reduced tax payments for those who clean up or fix up
their own property could be enacted. It is also easy to imagine how a
city might allow its businesses to form a group that would pay for and
manage neighborhood cleanup.

Government programs that either pay for education directly or that
provide loans or reduced tax payments for education could create
positive spillovers. A city might allow its businesses to form a group
that would coordinate business efforts with schools and local colleges
and universities---allowing students to obtain real-world experience in
their chosen fields and providing businesses with enthusiastic, trained
workers.

a.  Once citizens are protected from crime, it is difficult to exclude
    someone from this protection, so it is nonexcludable.
b.  Some satellite radio services, such as SiriusXM, are sold by
    subscription fee, so it is excludable.
c.  Once a road is built it is difficult to exclude people, although
    toll roads can exclude non-payers.
d.  Primary education can be provided by private companies and so it is
    excludable.
e.  Companies sell cell phone service and exclude those who do not pay.

a.  Two people cannot enjoy the same slice of pizza at the same time, so
    private goods, such as a slice of pizza, are rivalrous.
b.  Two people cannot use one laptop at the same time, so they are
    rivalrous in consumption.
c.  Public radio can be heard by anyone with a radio, so many people can
    listen at the same time---the good is nonrivalrous.
d.  It is difficult for two people to simultaneously eat an ice cream
    cone, so it is rivalrous in consumption.
