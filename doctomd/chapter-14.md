a.  For a firm operating in a perfectly competitive output market, the
    value of the marginal product is the marginal product of labor
    multiplied by the firm's output price.
b.  In a perfectly competitive labor market where the going market wage
    is \$12, a profit-maximizing firm will hire workers up to the point
    where the market wage equals the marginal revenue product. In this
    case, the market wage equals the marginal revenue product when the
    labor is 5 because at that level, the marginal revenue product is
    \$12.

a.  For firms with some market power in their output market, like a
    monopoly, the value of additional output sold is the firm's marginal
    revenue, not the price. This is because they face a downward sloping
    demand curve for output, which means that in order to sell
    additional output, the firm must lower its price. The marginal
    revenue product equals the marginal product of labor multiplied by
    the marginal revenue.
b.  A profit-maximizing firm will hire workers up to the point where the
    market wage equals the marginal revenue product. If the going market
    wage is \$20, in this scenario, the profit-maximizing level of
    employment is 4 because at that point, the marginal revenue product
    is \$20.

a.  With no union, the equilibrium wage rate would be \$18 per hour and
    there would be 8,000 bus drivers.
b.  If the union has enough negotiating power to raise the wage to \$4
    per hour higher than under the original equilibrium, the new wage
    would be \$22 per hour. At this wage, 4,000 workers would be
    demanded while 10,000 would be supplied, leading to an excess supply
    of 6,000 workers.

Unions have sometimes opposed new technology out of a fear of losing
jobs, but in other cases unions have helped to facilitate the
introduction of new technology because unionized workers felt that the
union was looking after their interests or that their higher skills
meant that their jobs were essentially protected. And the new
technologies meant increased productivity.

In a few other countries (such as France and Spain), the percentage of
workers belonging to a union is similar to that in the United States.
Union membership rates, however, are generally lower in the United
States. When the share of workers whose wages are determined by union
negotiations is considered, the United States ranks by far the lowest
(because in countries like France and Spain, union negotiations often
determine pay even for nonunion employees).

No. While some unions may cause firms to go bankrupt, other unions help
firms to become more competitive. No overall pattern exists.

[7](http://openstax.org/books/principles-microeconomics-3e/pages/14-self-check-questions#fs-idm83279824).

From a social point of view, the benefits of unions and the costs seem
to counterbalance. There is no evidence that in countries with a higher
percentage of unionized workers, the economies grow more or less slowly.

a.  The marginal cost of labor is the cost to the firm of hiring one
    more worker. To find the marginal cost of labor, one must divide the
    change in wage by the change in labor.
b.  Because the monopsonist is the sole employer in the labor market, it
    can offer any wage that it wishes. However, the marginal cost of
    labor will be greater than the wage for any number of workers more
    than one because hiring more than one worker requires paying a
    higher wage rate for both the new worker and all previous hires. A
    monopsony will hire workers up to the point where its demand for
    labor equals the marginal cost of additional labor.

a.  Firms have a profit incentive to sell to everyone, regardless of
    race, ethnicity, religion, or gender.
b.  A business that needs to hire workers to expand may also find that
    if it draws only from its accustomed pool of workers---say, White
    men---it lacks the workers it needs to expand production. Such a
    business would have an incentive to hire more women and minorities.
c.  A discriminatory business that is underpaying its workers may find
    those workers leaving for jobs with another employer who offers
    better pay. This market pressure could cause the discriminatory
    business to behave better.

[10](http://openstax.org/books/principles-microeconomics-3e/pages/14-self-check-questions#eip-525).

No. The earnings gap does not prove discrimination because it does not
compare the wages of men and women in the same job who have the same
amounts of education, experience, and productivity.

If a large share of immigrants have relatively low skills, then reducing
the number of immigrants would shift the supply curve of low-skill labor
back to the left, which would tend to raise the equilibrium wage for
low-skill labor.
