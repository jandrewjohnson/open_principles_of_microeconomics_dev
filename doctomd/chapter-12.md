The original equilibrium (before the external social cost of pollution
is taken into account) is where the private supply curve crosses the
demand curve. This original equilibrium is at a price of \$15 and a
quantity of 440. After taking into account the additional external cost
of pollution, the production becomes more costly, and the supply curve
shifts up. The new equilibrium will be at a price of \$30 and a quantity
of 410.

The first policy is command-and-control because it is a requirement that
applies to all producers.

Even though state or local governments impose these taxes, a company has
the flexibility to adopt technologies that will help it avoid the tax.

First, if each firm is required to reduce its garbage output by
one-fourth, then Elm will reduce five tons at a cost of \$5,500; Maple
will reduce 10 tons at a cost of \$13,500; Oak will reduce three tons at
a cost of \$22,500; and Cherry will reduce four tons at a cost of
\$18,000. Total cost of this approach: \$59,500. If the system of
marketable permits is put in place, and those permits shrink the weight
of allowable garbage by one-quarter, then pollution must still be
reduced by the same overall amount. However, now the reduction in
pollution will take place where it is least expensive.

Thus, the overall pattern of reductions here will be that Elm reduces
garbage by 20 tons and has 15 tons of permits to sell. Maple reduces by
five tons and needs to buy five tons of permits. Oak does not reduce
garbage at all, and needs to buy 15 tons of permits. Cherry reduces
garbage by 25 tons, which leaves it with five tons of permits to sell.
The total cost of these reductions would be \$56,300, a definite
reduction in costs from the \$59,500 cost of the command-and-control
option.

a.  See the answers in the following table. The marginal cost is
    calculated as the change in total cost divided by the change in
    quantity.

b.  The "optimal" level of pollution is where the marginal benefits of
    reducing it are equal to the marginal cost. This is at four million
    gallons.
c.  Marginal analysis tells us if the marginal costs of cleanup are
    greater than the marginal benefit, society could use those resources
    more efficiently elsewhere in the economy.

a.  See the next table for the answers, which were calculated using the
    traditional calculation of marginal cost equal to change in total
    cost divided by change in quantity.

b.  The optimal amount of restored land is 300 acres. Beyond this
    quantity the marginal costs are greater than the marginal benefits.

Country B will reason this way: If A protects the environment, then we
will have benefits of 6 if we act to protect the environment, but 8 if
we do not, so we will not protect it. If A is not protecting the
environment, we will have losses of 2 if we protect, but have zero if we
do not protect, so again, we will not protect it. Country A will reason
in a similar manner. The result is that both countries choose to not
protect, even though they will achieve the largest social benefits---a
combined benefit of 12 for the two countries---if they both choose to
protect. Environmental treaties can be viewed as a way for countries to
try to extricate themselves from this situation.

b.  Of the choices provided, P, R, and S demonstrate productive
    efficiency. These are the choices on the production possibility
    frontier.

c.  Allocative efficiency is determined by the preferences---in this
    case by the preferences of society as expressed through government
    and other social institutions. Because you do not have information
    about these preferences, you really cannot say much about allocative
    efficiency.

d.  In the choice between T and R, R should clearly be preferred,
    because it has both more corn and more trees. This answer
    illustrates why productive efficiency is beneficial. Compared with
    choices inside the PPF, it means more of one or both goods.

e.  In the choice between T and S, it is not possible to say which
    choice is better. True, S is on the PPF and T is not---but that only
    addresses the issue of productive efficiency. If a society has a
    strong preference for economic output and places a lower value on
    trees, then allocative efficiency may lead to a choice of T over S.
    Of course, the reverse could also be true, leading to a choice of S.
    Without information on society's preferences to judge allocative
    efficiency, this question cannot be answered.

f.  Compared with command-and-control policies, market-oriented policies
    allow either more output with the same environmental protection or
    more environmental protection with the same level of output---or
    more of both environmental protection and output. Thus, a choice
    like Q inside the PPF is more likely to represent a
    command-and-control policy demand than a choice like S on the
    frontier of the PPF.
