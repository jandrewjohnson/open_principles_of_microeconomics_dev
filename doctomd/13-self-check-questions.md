The Gizmo Company is planning to develop new household gadgets. [Table
13.4](#ch13mod01_tab03) shows the company's demand for financial capital
for research and development of these gadgets, based on expected rates
of return from sales. Now, say that every investment would have an
additional 5% social benefit---that is, an investment that pays at least
a 6% return to the Gizmo Company will pay at least an 11% return for
society as a whole; an investment that pays at least 7% for the Gizmo
Company will pay at least 12% for society as a whole, and so on. Answer
the questions that follow based on this information.

Table 13.4

a.  If the going interest rate is 9%, how much will Gizmo invest in R&D
    if it receives only the private benefits of this investment?
b.  Assume that the interest rate is still 9%. How much will the firm
    invest if it also receives the social benefits of its investment?
    (Add an additional 5% return on all levels of investment.)

happier residents. What types of government policies can encourage
neighborhoods to clean up?

Education provides both private benefits to those who receive it and
broader social benefits for the economy as a whole. Think about the
types of policies a government can follow to address the issue of
positive spillovers in technology and then suggest a parallel set of
policies that governments could follow for addressing positive
externalities in education.
