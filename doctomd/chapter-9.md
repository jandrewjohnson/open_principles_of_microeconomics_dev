a.  A patent is a government-enforced barrier to entry.
b.  This is not a barrier to entry.
c.  This is not a barrier to entry.
d.  This is a barrier to entry, but it is not government-enforced.
e.  This is a barrier to entry, but it is not directly government
    enforced.

a.  This is a government-enforced barrier to entry.
b.  This is an example of a government law, but perhaps it is not much
    of a barrier to entry if most people can pass the safety test and
    get insurance.
c.  Trademarks are enforced by government, and therefore are a barrier
    to entry.
d.  This is probably not a barrier to entry, since there are a number of
    different ways of getting pure water.
e.  This is a barrier to entry, but it is not government-enforced.

Because of economies of scale, each firm would produce at a higher
average cost than before. (They would each have to build their own power
lines.) As a result, they would each have to raise prices to cover their
higher costs. The policy would fail.

Shorter patent protection would make innovation less lucrative, so the
amount of research and development would likely decline.

If price falls below AVC, the firm will not be able to earn enough
revenues even to cover its variable costs. In such a case, it will
suffer a smaller loss if it shuts down and produces no output. By
contrast, if it stayed in operation and produced the level of output
where MR = MC, it would lose all of its fixed costs plus some variable
costs. If it shuts down, it only loses its fixed costs.

This scenario is called "perfect price discrimination." The result would
be that the monopolist would produce more output, the same amount in
fact as would be produced by a perfectly competitive industry. However,
there would be no consumer surplus since each buyer is paying exactly
what they think the product is worth. Therefore, the monopolist would be
earning the maximum possible profits.
