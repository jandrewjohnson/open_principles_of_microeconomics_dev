## Self-Check Questions

[1](http://openstax.org/books/principles-microeconomics-3e/pages/chapter-10#fs-idm64669072-solution).

Suppose that, due to a successful advertising campaign, a monopolistic
competitor experiences an increase in demand for its product. How will
that affect the price it charges and the quantity it supplies?

[2](http://openstax.org/books/principles-microeconomics-3e/pages/chapter-10#fs-idm141628400-solution).

Continuing with the scenario in question 1, in the long run, the
positive economic profits that the monopolistic competitor earns will
attract a response either from existing firms in the industry or firms
outside. As those firms capture the original firm's profit, what will
happen to the original firm's profit-maximizing price and output levels?

[3](http://openstax.org/books/principles-microeconomics-3e/pages/chapter-10#fs-idm16606608-solution).

Consider the curve in the figure below, which shows the market demand,
marginal cost, and marginal revenue curve for firms in an oligopolistic
industry. In this example, we assume firms have zero fixed costs.

a.  Suppose the firms collude to form a cartel. What price will the
    cartel charge? What quantity will the cartel supply? How much profit
    will the cartel earn?
b.  Suppose now that the cartel breaks up and the oligopolistic firms
    compete as vigorously as possible by cutting the price and
    increasing sales. What will be the industry quantity and price? What
    will be the collective profits of all firms in the industry?
c.  Compare the equilibrium price, quantity, and profit for the cartel
    and cutthroat competition outcomes.

Sometimes oligopolies in the same industry are very different in size.
Suppose we have a duopoly where one firm (Firm A) is large and the other
firm (Firm B) is small, as the prisoner's dilemma box in [Table
10.4](#Table_10_05) shows.

Table 10.4

Assuming that both firms know the payoffs, what is the likely outcome in
this case?
