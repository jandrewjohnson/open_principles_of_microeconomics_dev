    several birdhouses in the yard as well as planting trees and flowers
    that attract birds.
b.  Your neighbor paints his house a hideous color.
c.  Investments in private education raise your country's standard of
    living.

will stay the same for the following:

a.  Firms in an industry are required to pay a fine for their carbon
    dioxide emissions.
b.  Companies are sued for polluting the water in a river.
c.  Power plants in a specific city are not required to address the
    impact of their air quality emissions.

For each of your answers to [Exercise 12.2](#fs-idp37271888), will
equilibrium price rise or fall or stay the same?

[4](http://openstax.org/books/principles-microeconomics-3e/pages/chapter-12#fs-idm11018080-solution).

[Table 12.5](#Table_12_04) provides the supply and demand conditions for
a manufacturing firm. The third column represents a supply curve without
accounting for the social cost of pollution. The fourth column
represents the supply curve when the firm is required to account for the
social cost of pollution. Identify the equilibrium before the social
cost of production is included and after the social cost of production
is included.

Consider two approaches to reducing emissions of CO~2~ into the
environment from manufacturing industries in the United States. In the
first approach, the U.S. government makes it a policy to use only
predetermined technologies. In the second approach, the U.S. government
determines which technologies are cleaner and subsidizes their use. Of
the two approaches, which is the command-and-control policy?

[6](http://openstax.org/books/principles-microeconomics-3e/pages/chapter-12#fs-idp53675472-solution).

Classify the following pollution-control policies as command-and-control
or market incentive based.

a.  A state emissions tax on the quantity of carbon emitted by each
    firm.
b.  The federal government requires domestic auto companies to improve
    car emissions by 2020.
c.  The EPA sets national standards for water quality.
d.  A city sells permits to firms that allow them to emit a specified
    quantity of pollution.
e.  The federal government pays fishermen to preserve salmon.

[7](http://openstax.org/books/principles-microeconomics-3e/pages/chapter-12#fs-idm47024320-solution).

An emissions tax on a quantity of emissions from a firm is not a
command-and-control approach to reducing pollution. Why?

[8](http://openstax.org/books/principles-microeconomics-3e/pages/chapter-12#fs-idp168952928-solution).

Four firms called Elm, Maple, Oak, and Cherry, produce wooden chairs.
However, they also produce a great deal of garbage (a mixture of glue,
varnish, sandpaper, and wood scraps). The first row of [Table
12.6](#Table_12_07) shows the total amount of garbage (in tons) that
each firm currently produces. The other rows of the table show the cost
of reducing garbage produced by the first five tons, the second five
tons, and so on. First, calculate the cost of requiring each firm to
reduce the weight of its garbage by one-fourth. Now, imagine that the
government issues marketable permits for the current level of garbage,
but the permits will shrink the weight of allowable garbage for each
firm by one-fourth. What will be the result of this alternative approach
to reducing pollution?

The rows in [Table 12.7](#Table_12_09) show three market-oriented tools
for reducing pollution. The columns of the table show three complaints
about command-and-control regulation. Fill in the table by stating
briefly how each market-oriented tool addresses each of the three
concerns.

Table 12.7

[10](http://openstax.org/books/principles-microeconomics-3e/pages/chapter-12#fs-idm15713664-solution).

Suppose a city releases 16 million gallons of raw sewage into a nearby
lake. [Table 12.8](#Table_12_10) shows the total costs of cleaning up
the sewage to different levels, together with the total benefits of
doing so. (Benefits include environmental, recreational, health, and
industrial benefits.)

Table 12.8

a.  Using the information in [Table 12.8](#Table_12_10), calculate the
    marginal costs and marginal benefits of reducing sewage emissions
    for this city. See [Production, Costs and Industry
    Structure](http://openstax.org/books/principles-microeconomics-3e/pages/7-introduction-to-production-costs-and-industry-structure)
    if you need a refresher on how to calculate marginal costs.
b.  What is the optimal level of sewage for this city?
c.  Why not just pass a law that firms can emit zero sewage? After all,
    the total benefits of zero emissions exceed the total costs.

[11](http://openstax.org/books/principles-microeconomics-3e/pages/chapter-12#fs-idp33211776-solution).

The state of Colorado requires oil and gas companies who use fracking
techniques to return the land to its original condition after the oil
and gas extractions. [Table 12.9](#Table_12_12) shows the total cost and
total benefits (in dollars) of this policy.

Table 12.9

a.  Calculate the marginal cost and the marginal benefit at each
    quantity (acre) of land restored. See [Production, Costs and
    Industry
    Structure](http://openstax.org/books/principles-microeconomics-3e/pages/7-introduction-to-production-costs-and-industry-structure)
    if you need a refresher on how to calculate marginal costs and
    benefits.
b.  If we apply marginal analysis, what is the optimal amount of land to
    be restored?

[12](http://openstax.org/books/principles-microeconomics-3e/pages/chapter-12#fs-idp51747376-solution).

Consider the case of global environmental problems that spill across
international borders as a prisoner's dilemma of the sort studied in
[Monopolistic Competition and
Oligopoly](http://openstax.org/books/principles-microeconomics-3e/pages/10-introduction-to-monopolistic-competition-and-oligopoly).
Say that there are two countries, A and B. Each country can choose
whether to protect the environment, at a cost of 10, or not to protect
it, at a cost of zero. If one country decides to protect the
environment, there is a benefit of 16, but the benefit is divided
equally between the two countries. If both countries decide to protect
the environment, there is a benefit of 32, which is divided equally
between the two countries.

a.  In [Table 12.10](#Table_12_15), fill in the costs, benefits, and
    total payoffs to the countries of the following decisions. Explain
    why, without some international agreement, they are likely to end up
    with neither country acting to protect the environment.

A country called Sherwood is very heavily covered with a forest of
50,000 trees. There are proposals to clear some of Sherwood's forest and
grow corn, but obtaining this additional economic output will have an
environmental cost from reducing the number of trees. [Table
12.11](#Table_12_17) shows possible combinations of economic output and
environmental protection.

Table 12.11

a.  Sketch a graph of a production possibility frontier with
    environmental quality on the horizontal axis, measured by the number
    of trees, and the quantity of economic output, measured in corn, on
    the vertical axis.
b.  Which choices display productive efficiency? How can you tell?
c.  Which choices show allocative efficiency? How can you tell?
d.  In the choice between T and R, decide which one is better. Why?
e.  In the choice between T and S, can you say which one is better, and
    why?
f.  If you had to guess, which choice would you think is more likely to
    represent a command-and-control environmental policy and which
    choice is more likely to represent a market-oriented environmental
    policy, choice Q or S? Why?
