In discussions of setting budgets for government agencies, there is a
strategy called "closing the Washington Monument." When an agency faces
the unwelcome prospect of a budget cut, it may decide to close a
high-visibility attraction enjoyed by many people (like the Washington
Monument). Explain in terms of diminishing marginal utility why the
Washington Monument strategy is so misleading. *Hint*: If you are really
trying to make the best of a budget cut, should you cut the items in
your budget with the highest marginal utility or the lowest marginal
utility? Does the Washington Monument strategy cut the items with the
highest marginal utility or the lowest marginal utility?

income elasticity of the other good you buy?
