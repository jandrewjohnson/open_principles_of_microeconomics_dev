## Key Terms

constant unitary elasticity

:   when a given percent price change in price leads to an equal
    percentage change in quantity demanded or supplied

cross-price elasticity of demand

:   the percentage change in the quantity of good A that is demanded as
    a result of a percentage change in the price of good B

elastic demand

:   when the elasticity of demand is greater than one, indicating a high
    responsiveness of quantity demanded or supplied to changes in price

elastic supply

:   when the elasticity of either supply is greater than one, indicating
    a high responsiveness of quantity demanded or supplied to changes in
    price

elasticity

:   an economics concept that measures responsiveness of one variable to
    changes in another variable

elasticity of savings

:   the percentage change in the quantity of savings divided by the
    percentage change in interest rates

inelastic demand

:   when the elasticity of demand is less than one, indicating that a 1
    percent increase in price paid by the consumer leads to less than a
    1 percent change in purchases (and vice versa); this indicates a low
    responsiveness by consumers to price changes

inelastic supply

:   when the elasticity of supply is less than one, indicating that a 1
    percent increase in price paid to the firm will result in a less
    than 1 percent increase in production by the firm; this indicates a
    low responsiveness of the firm to price increases (and vice versa if
    prices drop)

infinite elasticity

:   the extremely elastic situation of demand or supply where quantity
    changes by an infinite amount in response to any change in price;
    horizontal in appearance

perfect elasticity

:   see infinite elasticity

perfect inelasticity

:   see zero elasticity

price elasticity

:   the relationship between the percent change in price resulting in a
    corresponding percentage change in the quantity demanded or supplied

price elasticity of demand

:   percentage change in the quantity *demanded* of a good or service
    divided the percentage change in price

price elasticity of supply

:   percentage change in the quantity *supplied* divided by the
    percentage change in price

tax incidence

:   manner in which the tax burden is divided between buyers and sellers

unitary elasticity

:   when the calculated elasticity is equal to one indicating that a
    change in the price of the good or service results in a proportional
    change in the quantity demanded or supplied

wage elasticity of labor supply

:   the percentage change in hours worked divided by the percentage
    change in wages

zero inelasticity

:   the highly inelastic case of demand or supply in which a percentage
    change in price, no matter how large, results in zero change in the
    quantity; vertical in appearance
