All other things being equal, voter turnout should increase as the cost
of casting an informed vote decreases.

The cost in time of voting, transportation costs to and from the polling
place, and any additional time and effort spent becoming informed about
the candidates.

The costs of organization and the small benefit to the individual.

Domestic cotton producers would lobby heavily to protect themselves from
the competition, whereas the consumers have little incentive to
organize.

True. This is exactly what occurs in a voting cycle. That is, the
majority can prefer policy A to policy B, policy B to policy C, but also
prefer policy C to policy A. Then, the majority will never reach a
conclusive outcome.

The problem is an example of a voting cycle. The group will vote for
mountain biking over canoeing by 2--1. It will vote for canoeing over
the beach by 2--1. If mountain biking is preferred to canoeing and
canoeing is preferred to the beach, it might seem that it must be true
that mountain biking is the favorite. But in a vote of the beach versus
mountain biking, the beach wins by a 2--1 vote. When a voting cycle
occurs, choosing a single favorite that is always preferred by a
majority becomes impossible.

The four Coca-Cola candidates compete with each other for Coca-Cola
voters, whereas everyone who prefers Pepsi had only one candidate to
vote for. Thus the will of the majority is not satisfied.
