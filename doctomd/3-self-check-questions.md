In an analysis of the market for paint, an economist discovers the facts
listed below. State whether each of these changes will affect supply or
demand, and in what direction.

a.  There have recently been some important cost-saving inventions in

b.  The winter is exceptionally cold.
c.  A major discovery of new oil is made off the coast of Norway.
