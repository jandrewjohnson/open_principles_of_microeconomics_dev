A firm is considering an investment that will earn a 6% rate of return.
If it were to borrow the money, it would have to pay 8% interest on the
loan, but it currently has the cash, so it will not need to borrow.
Should the firm make the investment? Show your work.

What is the marginal gain in output from increasing the number of
barbers from 4 to 5 and from 5 to 6? Does it continue the pattern of
diminishing marginal returns?

Compute the average total cost, average variable cost, and marginal cost
of producing 60 and 72 haircuts. Draw the graph of the three curves
between 60 and 72 haircuts.

A small company that shovels sidewalks and driveways has 100 homes
signed up for its services this winter. It can use various combinations
of capital and labor: intensive labor with hand shovels, less labor with
snow blowers, and still less labor with a pickup truck that has a
snowplow on front. To summarize, the method choices are:

Method 1: 50 units of labor, 10 units of capital

Method 2: 20 units of labor, 40 units of capital

Method 3: 10 units of labor, 70 units of capital

If hiring labor for the winter costs \$100/unit and a unit of capital
costs \$400, what is the best production method? What method should the
company use if the cost of labor rises to \$200/unit?
