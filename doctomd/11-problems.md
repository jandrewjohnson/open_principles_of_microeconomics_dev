37\.

If the transit system were allowed to operate as an unregulated
monopoly, what output would it supply and what price would it charge?

what approximate price would it charge?

39\.

If the transit system were regulated to provide the most allocatively
efficient quantity of output, what output would it supply and what price
would it charge? What subsidy would be necessary to ensure this
efficient provision of transit services?
