Show the market for cigarettes in equilibrium, assuming that there are
no laws banning smoking in public. Label the equilibrium private market
price and quantity as Pm and Qm. Add whatever is needed to the model to
show the impact of the negative externality from second-hand smoking.
(Hint: In this case it is the consumers, not the sellers, who are
creating the negative externality.) Label the socially optimal output
and price as Pe and Qe. On the graph, shade in the deadweight loss at
the market output.

Refer to [Table
12.2](http://openstax.org/books/principles-microeconomics-3e/pages/12-1-the-economics-of-pollution#Table_12_02).
The externality created by the refrigerator production was \$100.
However, once we accounted for both the private and additional external
costs, the market price increased by only \$50. If the external costs
were \$100 why did the price only increase by \$50 when we accounted for
all costs?

[Table 12.12](#Table_12_05) shows the supply and demand conditions for a
firm that will play trumpets on the streets when requested. Qs~1~ is the
quantity supplied without social costs. Qs~2~ is the quantity supplied
with social costs. What is the negative externality in this situation?
Identify the equilibrium price and quantity when we account only for
private costs, and then when we account for social costs. How does
accounting for the externality affect the equilibrium price and
quantity?

A city currently emits 16 million gallons (MG) of raw sewage into a lake
that is beside the city. [Table 12.13](#Table_12_14) shows the total
costs (TC) in thousands of dollars of cleaning up the sewage to
different levels, together with the total benefits (TB) of doing so.
Benefits include environmental, recreational, health, and industrial
benefits.

Table 12.13

a.  Using the information in [Table 12.13](#Table_12_14), calculate the
    marginal costs and marginal benefits of reducing sewage emissions
    for this city.
b.  What is the optimal level of sewage for this city? How can you tell?

In the Land of Purity, there is only one form of pollution, called
"gunk." [Table 12.14](#Table_12_18) shows possible combinations of
economic output and reduction of gunk, depending on what kinds of
environmental regulations you choose.

Table 12.14

a.  Sketch a graph of a production possibility frontier with
    environmental quality on the horizontal axis, measured by the
    percentage reduction of gunk, and with the quantity of economic
    output on the vertical axis.
b.  Which choices display productive efficiency? How can you tell?
c.  Which choices show allocative efficiency? How can you tell?
d.  In the choice between K and L, can you say which one is better and
    why?
e.  In the choice between K and N, can you say which one is better, and
    why?
f.  If you had to guess, which choice would you think is more likely to
    represent a command-and-control environmental policy and which
    choice is more likely to represent a market-oriented environmental
    policy, choice L or M? Why?
