a.  Imperfect information is relatively low; after all, you can see the
    apples.
b.  Imperfect information is relatively low. The neighborhood restaurant
    probably has a certain local reputation.
c.  Imperfect information is relatively high. How can you tell whether
    the computer is really in good working order? Why are they selling
    it?
d.  Imperfect information is relatively high. What do those flowers
    really look like?

Asymmetric information often exists in the labor market because
employers cannot observe many key employee attributes until after the
person is hired. Employees, however, know whether they are energetic or
detailed-oriented. Employers, therefore, often seek schools to
pre-screen candidates. Employers may not even interview a candidate
unless he has a degree and often a degree from a particular school.
Employers may also view awards, a high grade point average, and other
accolades as a signal of hard work, perseverance, and ability. Finally,
employers seek references for insights into key attributes such as
energy level, work ethic, and so on.

It is almost impossible to distinguish whether a health outcome such as
life expectancy was the result of personal preferences that might affect
health and longevity, such as diet, exercise, certain risky behavior,
and consumption of certain items like tobacco, or the result of
expenditures on health care (for example, annual check-ups).
