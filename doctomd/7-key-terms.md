## Key Terms

accounting profit

:   total revenues minus explicit costs, including depreciation

average profit

:   profit divided by the quantity of output produced; also known as
    profit margin

average total cost

:   total cost divided by the quantity of output

average variable cost

:   variable cost divided by the quantity of output

constant returns to scale

:   expanding all inputs proportionately does not change the average
    cost of production

diminishing marginal productivity

:   general rule that as a firm employs more labor, eventually the
    amount of additional output produced declines

diseconomies of scale

:   the long-run average cost of producing output increases as total
    output increases

economic profit

:   total revenues minus total costs (explicit plus implicit costs)

economies of scale

:   the long-run average cost of producing output decreases as total
    output increases

economies of scale

:   the long-run average cost of producing output decreases as total
    output increases

explicit costs

:   out-of-pocket costs for a firm, for example, payments for wages and
    salaries, rent, or materials

factors of production (or inputs)

:   resources that firms use to produce their products, for example,
    labor and capital

firm

:   an organization that combines inputs of labor, capital, land, and
    raw or finished component materials to produce outputs.

fixed cost

:   cost of the fixed inputs; expenditure that a firm must make before
    production starts and that does not change regardless of the
    production level

fixed inputs

:   factors of production that can't be easily increased or decreased in
    a short period of time

implicit costs

:   opportunity cost of resources already owned by the firm and used in
    business, for example, expanding a factory onto land already owned

long run

:   period of time during which all of a firm's inputs are variable

long-run average cost (LRAC) curve

:   shows the lowest possible average cost of production, allowing all
    the inputs to production to vary so that the firm is choosing its
    production technology

marginal cost

:   the additional cost of producing one more unit; mathematically,
    $MC = \Delta TC/\Delta L$

marginal product

:   change in a firm's output when it employees more labor;
    mathematically, $MP = \Delta TP/\Delta L$

private enterprise

:   the ownership of businesses by private individuals

production

:   the process of combining inputs to produce outputs, ideally of a
    value greater than the value of the inputs

production function

:   mathematical equation that tells how much output a firm can produce
    with given amounts of the inputs

production technologies

:   alternative methods of combining inputs to produce output

revenue

:   income from selling a firm's product; defined as price times
    quantity sold

short run

:   period of time during which at least one or more of the firm's
    inputs is fixed

short-run average cost (SRAC) curve

:   the average total cost curve in the short term; shows the total of
    the average fixed costs and the average variable costs

total cost

:   the sum of fixed and variable costs of production

total product

:   synonym for a firm's output

variable cost

:   cost of production that increases with the quantity produced; the
    cost of the variable inputs

variable inputs

:   factors of production that a firm can easily increase or decrease in
    a short period of time
