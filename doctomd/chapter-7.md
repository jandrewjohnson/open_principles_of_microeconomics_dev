Accounting profit = total revenues minus explicit costs = \$1,000,000 --
(\$600,000 + \$150,000 + \$200,000) = \$50,000.

Economic profit = accounting profit minus implicit cost = \$50,000 --
\$30,000 = \$20,000.

a.  Total revenues in this example will be a quantity of five units
    multiplied by the price of \$25/unit, which equals \$125. Total
    costs when producing five units are \$130. Thus, at this level of
    quantity and output the firm experiences losses (or negative
    profits) of \$5.
b.  If price is less than average cost, the firm is not making a profit.
    At an output of five units, the average cost is \$26/unit. Thus, at
    a glance you can see the firm is making losses. At a second glance,
    you can see that it must be losing \$1 for each unit produced (that
    is, average cost of \$26/unit minus the price of \$25/unit). With
    five units produced, this observation implies total losses of \$5.
c.  When producing five units, marginal costs are \$30/unit. Price is
    \$25/unit. Thus, the marginal unit is not adding to profits, but is
    actually subtracting from profits, which suggests that the firm
    should reduce its quantity produced.

The new table should look like this:

The firm should choose production technology 3 since it has the lowest
total cost. This makes sense since, with cheaper machine hours, one
would expect a shift in the direction of more machines and less labor.

The firm should choose production technology 2 since it has the lowest
total cost. Because the cost of machines increased (relative to the
previous question), you would expect a shift toward less capital and
more labor.

This is the situation that existed in the United States in the 1970s.
Since there is only demand enough for 2.5 firms to reach the bottom of
the average cost curve, you would expect one firm will not be around in
the long run, and at least one firm will be struggling.
